# 04. FROM PEOPLE’S PARKS TO THE PEOPLE’S ARCHIVE: POWER, IDENTITY, AND THE RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION IN THE MEDIA SINCE THE 1960S

### KERA LOVELL

## Introduction

The amorphous People’s Park movement was a sporadic chain of more than
four dozen protests across the United States in the late Vietnam War era
in which activists protested a range of issues including police
brutality, gentrification, and systemic racism by taking over vacant
lots and insurgently converting those lots into informal parks they
often called ‘people’s parks’. Most of these park projects were
ephemeral, often being fenced and torn down by police only days or weeks
after construction began.[^06Chapter4_1] Because of their inherently short lifespan
as well as the fact that these illegal formations at times ignited
violent conversations over spatial power, park creators in the late
1960s and early 1970s created their own informal archives of parks to
galvanize support for their movements. In this chapter, I use the
People’s Park Movement to explore how activists worked as
archivists—creating and compiling their own materials outside the bounds
of institutional archives. While scholarship on the relationship between
archives and activism has tended to focus on community archives, the
People’s Park movement resulted in a disparate constellation of archival
materials across the United States that offer a kaleidoscopic view of
the movement.[^06Chapter4_2] From regulated institutions to social media accounts,
the People’s Park movement presents an alternative lens through which to
explore power and representation in the historical memory of social
movements.

Archival materials on largely white male-dominated park creations abound
with a wide array of accessible primary sources, including: photography,
film, audio recordings, oral history interviews and testimonies, and
newsprint media as the basis for galleries, books, and later archival
collections, websites, and social media accounts. Since the late 1960s,
supporters have used this archival material to not only validate that
these spaces and projects existed, but to construct their own historical
memories of these protest actions counter to the state. Documenting park
protests not only served as a tool for park creators to control their
own narrative separate from the mainstream media and the state, but also
to create satellite spaces to memorialize them after their demolition.
While social media has quickened the pace of building activist
movements, an analysis of the social media archives of Berkeley’s
People’s Park and more contemporary parks reveals how digital organizing
has not changed the tactics of protesters who seek to build ‘an archive
of feelings’[^06Chapter4_3] that connects the personal with the political. Despite
the wide variety of parks created by racially diverse groups in this
era, an abundance of material on Berkeley’s People’s Park in the late
1960s has contributed to an ‘archival fever’ on this site, which, in
turn, has centered white men in the archives and histories of this
movement.[^06Chapter4_4] Putting the archival tactics of people’s parks in
conversation with the work of women who participated in contemporary
occupations like Occupy Wall Street and the Taksim-Gezi Park protest
allows us to creatively explore the racialized and gendered
historiographical gaps on these emotional archives.

## The park as an archive

People’s Parks served as archives for the street people, activists, and
outliers of their communities. The original callout for Berkeley’s
People’s Park offered the parcel as a blank slate with suggested
programming that might attract a variety of interested workers: ‘We
could have a child care clinic or a crafts commune which would
communicate its wares by having medieval style fairs, a baseball
diamond, a rock concert, or a place to think and sleep in the sun’.[^06Chapter4_5]
Recorded footage demonstrates how some users brought chairs, car seats,
and sleeping bags to both Berkeley’s People’s Park and People’s Park
\#6, yet otherwise the space had minimal seating.[^06Chapter4_6] Piecing together
the memoirs of those who attended Berkeley’s People’s Park illuminates a
landscape of scattered jugs of wine, Band-Aid wrappers, and possibly the
crusts of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. At San Diego’s Chicano
Park, you would have navigated through leftover tamales and water hoses,
likely flyers for the neighborhood’s Chicano Free Clinic featuring the
symbolic flag of Aztlán. At Chicago’s Poor People’s Park, as documented
by historian Studs Terkel, the park contained flyers in support of
various organizations advocating for affordable housing, as well as kids
toys and playground equipment.[^06Chapter4_7] Flexible spaces and objects that
created opportunities for work, rest, and play could emerge
spontaneously, allowing park goers to explore their own ideas and
identities through materiality. Sculptures, stages, and swings became
seats and play areas, opportunities for self-reflection and
socialization. At Herrick Peace and Freedom Park, park goers hung
inspirational signs in newly-planted fruit trees.[^06Chapter4_8] Later on that same
lot that would become Berkeley’s People’s Park, someone dragged four
large three-dimensional orange letters spelling ‘KNOW’ where teenagers
lounged. Stories like these are celebrated in Terri Compost’s published
archive, *People’s Park: Still Blooming*, which features photos, scans
of publications, and most importantly, brief oral histories on the
various experiences park goers had with objects and spaces within the
park.[^06Chapter4_9] The vast array of objects collected there as well as the
laborers and park goers these spaces attracted often resulted in gawking
onlookers who were head-scratchingly confused.[^06Chapter4_10]

When underground reporters (initially park organizers) described
Berkeley’s People’s Park as it was being built, they did so by listing
an inventory of objects, people, and activities the park manifested:
‘Flower and vegetable gardens were planted…Nursery swings and a sliding
board appeared…old benches and newly-made ones were fine for sitting
down and being amazed at what was happening’.[^06Chapter4_11] Wildflower and
vegetable gardens as well as new trees, shrubs, and flowers were
concentrated in the far west and peripheral edges of the park. Park
participants appear to have randomly scattered wooden benches and small
scaffolds whose rustic look and feel countered the smooth surfaces of
the ‘cheap mass “plastic” accouterments of suburban life’.[^06Chapter4_12] Seating
areas, platforms, and interactive sculptural elements emerged like
stalagmites in a sea of dusty gravel-speckled dirt in the far southeast
corner. Parks were canvases for collaborative folk art, with users
contributing their own artifacts to the landscape that were subsequently
moved and reimagined by park goers. Many of these objects and spaces
were mentioned by park goers in the underground press and by scholars in
subsequent histories of People’s Parks in ways that read like lists—the
variety of objects and spaces a metaphor for the diversity of people the
park attracted. The park contained a collection of objects—the objects,
in turn, serving as ‘proof’ that these spaces were used and enjoyed by
many, even loved.

Park objects were most often destroyed when parks were fenced or raided.
As bulldozers demolished Herrick Peace and Freedom Park in 1968, park
supporters took photos of fledgling trees snapped in two. In one photo,
the bulldozer heads toward a folk-art mannequin with a body made of old
cans and wood, the mannequin lounging on a twin mattress in the park.
Dust clouds the ripper teeth of the bulldozer’s bucket. Photographs
represent the demolition as a traumatic event, what park creators
described as a double loss of life of both Chuck Herrick and the park
they had constructed in his memory after his death in an automobile
accident.[^06Chapter4_13] Because parks were often suddenly demolished in early
mornings to take park creators off guard and because park creators
resisted these demolitions by doubling down as occupiers, no
institutional archive contains objects from the People’s Park movement
in the late Vietnam War era. Occupy Wall Street offers a model for what
objects park creators might have archived. Like the participants of
Berkeley’s People’s Park, Occupiers had emotional connections to certain
objects within Zuccotti Park because of experiences they had during the
protest. Even Occupy Archivist Amy Roberts, thinking back on her
favorite item archived from Occupy, lights up describing a polyester
neon orange sign used for the Occupy Kitchen. When police were
attempting to use orange mesh fencing to corner and ultimately arrest
Occupiers, the activists commandeered it and converted it into a sign
for their own use. Roberts was part of a small group that had ventured
to the City of New York Department of Sanitation to retrieve the sign
after police evicted occupants in a late-night raid. Its safe retrieval
after so many items in the park, especially the People’s Library, had
been destroyed by trash compactors, was a small victory of symbolic
resistance.[^06Chapter4_14]

Some protesters, like Esen Kara who was a graduate student taking part
in the Gezi Park occupation in 2013, cannot recall saving anything from
their multi-week experience living in the protest camp. Despite wearing
handkerchiefs everyday as quick protection against tear gas attacks,
Kara does not recall keeping or reminiscing about any flyers or photos
over the past decade. When the Gezi Park occupation started over the
proposed demolition of 600 trees to make way for the reconstruction of
the former Taksim Military Barracks and a shopping mall, Kara dropped
what she was doing and immediately flew to Istanbul to join the protest.
Yet as Turkish author Ece Temelkuran argued, ‘it was never just about
the trees, but the accumulation of many incidents’. Temelkuran, whose
words originally written on Twitter are now archived on the Gezi Park
occupation liveblog *Mashallah News*, tweeted, ‘With the world’s highest
number of imprisoned journalists, thousands of political prisoners
(trade unionists, politicians, activists, students, lawyers), Turkey has
been turned into an open-air prison already’.[^06Chapter4_15] For both Berkeley and
Istanbul, the demolition of trees within waning access to urban green
space signified lack of control over their country. During the
occupation, occupiers replanted seedlings in the park in the shape of a
peace symbol, as well as in empty tear gas canisters. Park goers taped
signs to the remaining trees with the names of Kurds killed in the
Uludere/Roboski massacre.[^06Chapter4_16] To memorialize her own participation,
Esen Kara had a tree tattooed on her upper arm with a ‘swirling
trunk…meant to look like a female body, as the symbol of the ‘woman in
red’ of the Gezi Park protests’.[^06Chapter4_17] Ceyda Sungur, an urban planning
graduate student at the protest, would become the ‘lady in red’ when
police troops sprayed her with pepper spray so forcefully that it sent
her hair and red dress into a whirlwind.[^06Chapter4_18] For Kara, the trees, and
by extension the woman protecting them, became a symbol for much larger
issues about human rights and the abuse of state power — ’the symbolic
figure that started it all’ that shaped her own memories of the protest.
At Berkeley’s People’s Park, the site’s old growth redwood trees
similarly captivated park goers, and still serve as a symbol for
protestors of the capitalist-driven motivations for demolishing the
park. Over the past few decades, as the University of
California-Berkeley has reignited its campaign to reclaim power over the
site, activists continue to argue that protecting the trees is essential
to maintaining the free-thinking, spatially-liberated community that the
park embodies to them.

## The Press in the early era

The local underground newspaper, the *Berkeley Barb*, serves as one of
the first archives and recruitment tools for Berkeley’s People’s Park.
Most coverage of the park in its early days is written from the
perspective of largely white middle-class journalists and photographers,
including Stew Albert, Art Goldberg, Paul Glusmen, Jon Jakobson, and
more who wrote for the *Berkeley Tribe*, *Ramparts*, and the *Daily
Californian*. Park construction was messy and disorganized, with its
‘contribute what you like’ attitude creating an aura of chaos under the
facade of a countercultural ‘happening’. Park coverage mimicked this
mindset by focusing on topless women and famous (male) political figures
who stopped by the park as a way to promote its popularity.[^06Chapter4_19] Very
few women were able to publish reports on Berkeley’s People’s Park in
the white male-dominated *Berkeley Barb*. As tensions escalated and
reports on the park’s demolition and defense became headline news, women
and people of color were among the photographers whose work was later
shown in exhibitions at Berkeley Phoenix Gallery and its printed
catalog, including Mitch Ikuta, Jerry Takigawa, Jeanne Raisler, and Ruth
Rosen among others. Those names are buried beneath that of the
exhibition’s white male curator.[^06Chapter4_20] Turning over the large, thick
photo placards at the Library of Congress where the ‘Alan Copeland’
collection is held, you can see their names faintly written in pencil on
the back, written so lightly as if with the intent to ultimately be
erased.

As scholar Jarrett Drake has argued, the foundational principles of
ownership and authorship structuring archival science—and I would argue
by extension print journalism—‘valorize and venerate white western
masculinity’, resulting in skewed initial reporting that has produced
white and male-dominated archival materials on Berkeley’s People’s Park
in particular.[^06Chapter4_21] While shaped by gendered and racialized mindsets and
power structures, the Alternative Press Syndicate worked with the
company Bell and Howell to microfilm tens of thousands of newspapers
from the postwar era in the 1980s—the base set forming more than 400
microfilm reels that are accessible at more than 100 universities as
well as through Interlibrary Loan.[^06Chapter4_22] In the past decade, open access
digitization of thousands of issues of the underground press has allowed
scholars to quickly search terms across categorical divides, such as
seeing representations of Berkeley’s People’s Park in the campus
underground versus its representation in Black Power or feminist
periodicals.[^06Chapter4_23] While digital access to these early reports has
increased public knowledge about nearly a dozen activist-created parks
created in the Bay area at this time, the initial archive created within
the underground press often reiterated sexist stereotypes and racial
tropes that reinforced white men as the leaders in alliance with Black
male outsiders.[^06Chapter4_24] In turn, some park creators of color in other
cities around the country adapted the tactic of park creation as a
method of protest, but positioned their working-class park as
oppositional to countercultural back-to-the-land movements with simply
‘hip people fighting for some greenery’.[^06Chapter4_25]

After Berkeley’s People’s Park was fenced, coverage in the local
newspapers revealed mounting antagonism between park defenders and the
state—with park supporters threatening to reclaim it and the state
arguing it was obligated to protect private property rights violently if
necessary. While a group of students and faculty in support of the park
attempted to negotiate with university administrators over the course of
the week, California Governor Ronald Reagan was outspoken in his
critique of leniency. Reagan had been elected on a platform of quieting
student unrest after Berkeley’s notorious Free Speech Movement had
garnered international attention just a few years earlier. After
violence broke out over the park on May 15 known as ‘Bloody Thursday’,
Governor Ronald Reagan stationed more than 2000 National Guardsmen in
the park and on streets to regulate pedestrian access across nearly
eighteen square blocks in the South Berkeley area. The city became a
military occupation. Alameda County Sheriff Deputies moved throughout
the city, matching frustrations by locals with escalated aggression.
Rock throwing and fists held high were met with fixed bayonets,
nightsticks, and gas masks. Law enforcement squads guarded vacant lots
and parks, enforced an evening curfew, and restricted public gatherings,
assemblies, and loitering. By Monday, May 19, groups of protestors began
flying kites in vacant lots to keep hovering helicopters preparing to
teargas the city at bay.[^06Chapter4_26] During this period of conflict, hundreds
of civilians were arrested in various altercations with police and
National Guardsmen while at least a dozen new activist-created parks
were planted and at times literally stomped out by police across the
city within hours or days.

The *Instant News Service*, the *Berkeley Barb*, and other Left-leaning
newspapers began focusing their attention on how the military and police
had lacked restraint in regulating the protests, often escalating
violence through violent attacks on passersby. Eli Leon, who would later
become an important collector of African American quilts in the Bay
area, began collecting witness statements on the abuse of police force
in an effort to strengthen the defense for those wrongfully arrested or
injured and seeking compensation. Cathy Clark’s statement focused on May
15, as she expressed shock at seeing police shoot activists without
warning and laughing as victims writhed in pain.[^06Chapter4_27] After Bloody
Thursday, supporters of the park creation immediately responded by
attempting to reclaim the park and construct new ‘liberated zones’ or
activist-controlled mini parks and encampments throughout the city. In
addition, park creators also began creating their own archives of their
memories of People’s Park in an effort to acknowledge its existence and
confirm its value through shared use and approval. Photographer Alan
Copeland collected dozens of negatives, newspapers, and photographs
taken by a wide range of photographers of militarized Berkeley that
became an exhibition at Berkeley’s Phoenix Gallery in September and
October of 1969.[^06Chapter4_28] Park supporters like Copeland approached their
archival work (both material and digital) as forms of activism, seeking
to collect audio, visual, and written documentation showing that the
parks were being created and that the state was enacting violence
against park goers. Yet park advocates and troops returned—this cycle of
insurgent gardening and, in response, forced removal created a trail of
growth and destruction, celebration and defense, across the city. As
park creations became more ephemeral, newspapers became an extension of
urban space and allowed for informal parks to be legitimized and
memorialized. The underground press continued to serve as a form of
‘information activism’—an accessible technological medium that allowed
park supporters to create a diverse movement through shared experiences
of displacement and police brutality, as well as shared goals of urban
autonomy, ecological design, and communal infrastructures.[^06Chapter4_29]

## Institutionalized archives versus websites and social media

Due to the widespread media attention directed at Berkeley during
altercations between park allies and the police, archival material on
Berkeley’s People’s Park is exhaustive, encompassing hundreds of boxes
of material across numerous archives from the Bancroft Library at UC
Berkeley to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The extensive
material on Berkeley’s People’s Park contrasts sharply with the dozens
of other case studies of activist-created parks as civil disobedient
placemaking projects that I have identified in my own research, some of
whom only have one folder’s worth of material formally archived. The
voices of men—particularly white heterosexual middle-class men in
positions of power—are the most well-documented. The papers of white
male politicians and university administrators are collected and
organized chronologically within university and state archives, making
them more accessible for researchers. Additionally, white male political
leaders in the New Left who had access to the press as a platform for
power have also had their papers collected and stored, while print,
microfilm, and digital archives of their writings have reinforced their
dominance within 1960s activism. In contrast, some parks created by
people of color might have only been documented by one photograph, with
the park’s creators now scattered across the United States and, more
than fifty years later, with little memory of the park’s development. In
a historical moment in which protestors were wary of hierarchical
leadership structures and eager to make cross-cultural, transnational
connections in anti-racist organizing, the names of white men ironically
became fundamental to telling the stories of Berkeley’s People’s Park
and the larger People’s Park movement.

However, if the original park creators had thought through the
institutionalization of social movement archives, I imagine they would
be outraged at the rigidly regulated access to their materials found at
archives like the Bancroft Library. Even before Covid, accessing the
Bancroft Library’s reading room was nothing short of entering a prison,
with an extensive multi-week wait to view refrigerated audio-visual
materials, multiple bag checks upon entry, and strict limitations such
as the allowance of only five pieces of loose-leaf paper. Likewise,
there are many obstacles to access to the Chicago Red Squad Records,
hosted by the Chicago Museum, containing hundreds of boxes of
surveillance reports produced by the local police as part of the Counter
Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO). These reports include references to
activist-created parks in the city. The collection evidences aggressive
and illegal policing tactics used to subvert and fragment local social
justice organizations. After paying your entry fee to access the
archive, you are required to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that
you will never cite anything from the collection. When I asked a Reading
Room attendant why the collection required an NDA, the archivist
responded that nondisclosure offered privacy to figures in the past.
However, I would argue it protects police rather than all historical
figures equally. As Jacques Derrida argues, ‘There is no political power
without control of the archive, its constitution, and its
interpretation’.[^06Chapter4_30] Through its NDA, the Red Squad Collection’s
silencing of scholars, who are unable to write on the interrogation of
activists, does more to preserve the power of the police than challenge
it. The experience of Jose ‘Cha-Cha’ Jimenez offers a case in point. In
an effort to expose systemic police brutality against the Puerto Rican
and Chicago-based Young Lords Organization, leader Jose ‘Cha-Cha’
Jimenez requested access to his own arrest records via the Freedom of
Information Act and included the police reports he received in the
archive he created at Grand Valley State University. The Young Lords had
been part of a cross-cultural coalition of activist groups in Chicago
protesting urban renewal using a variety of means, including the
creation of ‘Poor People’s Park’. The police records Jimenez archived
reflect how the Chicago Police Department used informants to monitor
urban renewal meetings, court hearings, and press conferences, utilized
surveillance to follow attendees and their cars after demonstrations,
and relief on police officers to collect business cards and other
material on known affiliations from arrestees’ pockets.[^06Chapter4_31] However,
those same records in the Chicago Museum’s Red Squad Collection cannot
legally be referenced.

Since the early 1990s, advocates for People’s Parks have used their own
published media and the internet to create their own archive and
platform in support of the project. Peoplespark.org was organized in
1996 as part of a larger resistance to the University of California,
Berkeley’s campaign to reclaim People’s Park to convert it into
volleyball courts. Although several public hearings featured raucous
critiques from Berkeley’s Landmarks Preservation Commission, the Parks
and Rec Commission, and the Peace and Justice Commission, UC Berkeley
broke ground on the property in 1991. Protests were held at the lot
every weekend, often featuring advocate David Nadel who shared an
archive of photos while telling the history of the site.[^06Chapter4_32] After
riots intensified and a woman named Rosebud Denovo was shot attempting
to break into the Chancellor’s home to protest the park takeover, park
advocates underwent years of negotiation with the Berkeley City Council.
By 1996 when PeoplesPark.org was created, the website was poised to
serve as the first digitized archive of the protest. Featuring recorded
speeches by muralist and homeless advocacy lawyer Osha Newmann, as well
as photos of the park creation and park ephemera, over the past decade
the website has transitioned to now include more links to other park
advocates posting their own primary sources on the park across the
internet.

Social media sites have allowed illegal park projects to create somewhat
interactive, publicly accessible archives. Instagram in particular has
allowed park organizers to recruit workers, solicit donations, and most
importantly synthesize their message on a platform that seamlessly
allows their political action to blend into the personal lives of their
supporters. Twitter’s use of geotagging and hashtags has helped
transform protest, allowing protesters like Esen Kara at the Gezi Park
Occupation the ability to be able to coordinate logistics and connect
with fellow activists immediately.[^06Chapter4_33] According to reporter Ben
Berkowitz, within 24 hours of the Zuccotti Park occupation in 2011, the
hashtag \#occupywallstreet had become so popular that one of every 500
tweets in the world included that hashtag.[^06Chapter4_34] Instagram has become an
integral tool for contemporary park creations and occupations like
Weelaunee People’s Park (@defendatlantaforest) and Plaza del Pueblo
(@missiondefence\_sf) to connect with other parks like Berkeley’s
People’s Park and build a shared platform with other social justice
organizations who are then tagged in stories and posts when they visit
the park. While in 1969 it took days if not weeks for different
newspapers to travel across the country and for different groups to
respond, social media allows for instantaneous connections from a
diverse group of perspectives largely outside the bounds of state
interference. The speed of global social media, however, still presents
new obstacles that 1960s-era park creators did not face, such as digital
requirements for account creation, account deletion, institutional
censorship through social media companies, and more.

While Twitter is useful for activists to share information about law
enforcement and locations quickly, perhaps one of the most important
purposes served by social media archives like those on Instagram is to
keep energy levels high. On @thepeoples\_park, one of several official
and unofficial Instagram accounts for Berkeley’s People’s Park, you can
find photos and videos of supporters in the park. Children, the
houseless, parents, college students, and neighborhood residents all
stop to share their thoughts on the park. In the immediate aftermath of
the fencing of Berkeley’s People’s Park in 1969, creating archives felt
like essential and yet exhausting work for park supporters. The sheer
volume of events, exhibitions, and printed memoirs on the park released
during this time is difficult to sort through, and these archives were
produced within the context of emotional trauma. In her own recollection
of her experience at Occupy Wall Street movement, Amy Roberts described
taking a pause from graduate school after Occupy dissipated due to
suffering depression culminating from not only the traumatic
early-morning police raid that put an end to the movement after months
of occupation, but from ‘an accumulation of stress from police
brutality, government surveillance, blaming \[herself\], and at times
toxic and abusive behavior’ within the movement.[^06Chapter4_35] Archiving the
protest while weathering the movement was deeply emotional. Frustrations
carried through from Zuccotti Park to the archival group listserv, as
sharp, bitter disagreements over what and where to archive the
collection began to carry a sexist tone with no structure set up to
resolve it. The critiques, harassment, constant arrests, and overly
sexual poetry sent on the Archives Working Group Listserv by men to a
working group of largely women—all of it left a bitter taste in her
mouth. Roberts, who is still connected with some of the movement, said
that many fellow Occupiers declined an offer to later publish a piece on
Michael Bloomberg’s presidential run despite his ardent attack on the
Occupy Wall Street People’s Library. Having donated her journals
documenting her Occupy work as part of the collection, Roberts is now
considering requesting they be returned now that her context and views
on social movement archival organizing have shifted. Her own experiences
beg the question of how the depression and anxiety park creators felt
during the archival process shaped the archives that were produced in
this era that largely focus on the trauma of police brutality.

After UC Berkeley swept the park on August 3, 2022, cutting down trees
to make way for a new student housing project, social media coverage of
the park soared.[^06Chapter4_36] On Instagram, multiple accounts dedicated to
Berkeley’s People’s Park have focused on building camaraderie through
celebrations of community support for the park. Arthur tells the camera:
‘I just want to thank everyone who are (sic) protesting who are making a
difference for that to stop happening’.[^06Chapter4_37] In another photo a white
man kicks into the air as they swing gleefully on the recently-added
makeshift swing hanging from the Caterpillar excavator still on
site.[^06Chapter4_38] More recently the Instagram account @peoplesparkberkeley that
posted pictures of their recent park barbecue, followers respond in the
comments: ‘The grass is starting to get green again amazing and
beautiful it makes me happy to see green grass again (sic)’.[^06Chapter4_39] Thanks
to the workings of Instagram as a social movement archive, People’s Park
transforms from a physical site to a nostalgic one—an imagined space
where the past and present, park supporters and spectators, can engage
with the movement. While social media archives contain many of the same
elements as institutionalized archives—photos, videos, graphics, and a
digital trail of networking through comments, likes, and shares—one of
the most important contributions that digital media archiving offers is
the possibility of seeing community reactions to that archived material
in real time.

## Conclusion

The underground press became a tool in the pre-internet era for social
movement groups to network while creating their own archives of protest
outside the bounds of institutionalized repositories. As the work of
early archival activists transitioned through the emergence of the
digital era, the motivations for preservation adapted from the
mimeograph era in the later years of the Vietnam War era through the
world wide web from the 1990s to the 2000s, to what some are predicting
to be the social media decline of the 2020s. Despite more than fifty
years passing since the first known protest park creations in 1967,
imagery and other archived materials from the first wave are still
popular on park organizing platforms today that help drive the relevance
of these issues. From the underground press to Instagram stories, park
supporters continue to politicize the archives they socially construct,
using historic and contemporary media to create socio-cultural political
spaces in ways that continue to claim power long after spatial takeovers
are gone. Putting the early underground press and receipt-collecting
eras in conversation with new social media tactics of activist archiving
illuminates the adaptation of Derrida’s concept of ‘archive fever’
across archival technologies. Bloody Thursday helped ignite an archival
fever: ‘a compulsive, repetitive, nostalgic desire for the archive, an
irrepressible desire to return to the origin, a homesickness, a
nostalgia for the return to the most archaic place of absolute
commencement’.[^06Chapter4_40] As contests over the lot at the corner of Haste and
Bowditch have fluctuated over the years, the fever has shifted, at times
spread, and is currently taking new forms through geotagging and
reposting on social media by connecting contemporary occupations with
historic ones. Examining the archival practices of the People’s Park
movement reveals how Vietnam War-era activists used sculptural and print
and later digital media to shape discourse about their own political
actions and identities. Activist-created parks themselves were archives
of objects—layers of plant matter, tools, art, lost items, and waste
that all became part of the landscape of protest that shaped how park
goers related to the larger movement, bridging the personal with the
political. When combined with later oral histories of the park such as
those in Terri Compost’s collection, the park itself served as what Ann
Cvetkovich has called ‘an archive of feelings’. Feelings and emotions
are not only encoded into the contents of the objects and historical
reflections on those objects, but ‘in the practices that surround their
production and reception‘[^06Chapter4_41] within the park and within satellite
archives and spaces. As trauma escalated at Berkeley’s People’s Park
such on and after Bloody Thursday, this trauma has ‘served as a point of
entry’ into the archive as a repository of those encoded feelings and
histories. As trauma continues to escalate over the right to space such
as the recent police murder of Weelaunee People’s Park creator
Tortuguita in Atlanta, those emotional entry points into the archive
make their way to social media spaces. While social media archives of
parks largely remain hopeful, when police brutality and park demolitions
cyclically escalate, putting the lives of people and plants at risk,
trauma becomes centered in the narrative to catalyze an emotional
response from park supporters to rally support during these moments of
crisis.

While we do not have a record of the emotional toll of archival work by
park supporters in the late Vietnam War era, we do know from activists
like Amy Roberts, that the task of documenting a movement can, at times,
feel impossible even for archival professionals. Roberts had been in
graduate school for library and information sciences at Queen’s College
when joining the Archives Working Group for Occupy Wall Street, and knew
that her activist organizing experiences could make her helpful to the
movement. Yet disagreements within the Archives Working Group were
constant, and tension caused by police harassment mounted. How can one
‘loosely’ defined horizontally-structured group with little
accountability manage a project that could barely begin to account for
the daily production of thousands of signs, art and other printed work,
and material culture of the protest itself—let alone daily livestream
feeds in addition to tens of thousands of photos and videos? If anyone
can transform a pizza delivery cardboard box into a protest sign in the
Occupy Sign Garden, which of the thousands of handmade signs do we keep?
What is trash and what is a historically significant banner? How do we
preserve materials that have been outside and in the rain day after day
of encampment or crushed in the trash compactor during a police sweep?
How can materials constructed within Zuccotti Park account for the
national and international reach of the Occupy Movement? And perhaps
most important to the working group, what institution could we trust to
preserve Occupy materials and make them accessible to the public? The
working group had many questions with little time to resolve them before
new challenges arose, but unlike many other protest movements, they had
an archival management team to take the lead. Later into the occupation,
the United Federation of Teachers offered Occupy an empty space for
archival storage, expanding opportunities for archiving. The donation
solved the problem of materials being damaged when exposed to the
elements within Zuccotti Park while creating another; with a designated
archival drop-off site accessible to everyone and plenty of space, any
Occupier could designate an item as archivally worthy. Within a
horizontal leadership structure, who maintains the responsibility of
turning objects away? What is a ‘good’ object to archive? Rather than
making administrative choices prioritizing certain materials, the
working group accepted as much as they could. In turn, according to
Roberts, the Occupy Wall Street Archives Working Group Collection at the
[Tamiment Library and Wagner Labor
Archives](http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/tamwag/tam_630/) is now
home to a large piece of drywall. Looking to Occupy as a contemporary
model, what dirty, odd, and even dangerous objects might People’s Park
archivists have collected if they had been given the opportunity? And
would those objects have reflected more of the park’s functional or
ideological sides?

Putting Roberts’s experience at Occupy Wall Street in conversation with
Berkeley’s People’s Park and the broader People’s Park movement begs the
question of the future of social movement archiving. While the archives
retaining the most amount of records for Berkeley’s People Park remain
institutionalized, the social media archives these movements are
creating continue to be socially constructed—embedded within social,
political, and social power structures in a historical context of
‘cancel culture’ that encourages editing as a tool of self-preservation.
Watching KRON-TV’s silent footage of Berkeley’s People’s Park in April
of 1969 brings photos of the park to life before it was fenced.[^06Chapter4_42] The
swing sets and sandboxes are filled with playful crowds. The coffee
percolator boils on a steel beam atop a campfire. Adults pass around
jugs of wine and paper grocery bags filled with bread. If given the
opportunity to go back in time and archive the movement, what would I
choose to preserve? As Cvetkovich has argued, ‘The often ephemeral
nature of queer life necessitates a creative approach to archiving, an
openness to unusual objects and collections, and an acknowledgment of
that which escapes the archive’.[^06Chapter4_43] Despite Berkeley’s People’s Park
serving as a sensory experience, merging visual culture, material
culture, and performance, archives on Berkeley’s park and others are
very traditional due to the institutionalization of the archives. There
are no plant clippings, seeds, nor gardening gloves in the archives.
There are no teargas canisters, no gas masks, no bloody shirts torn from
buckshot that dominated coverage of Bloody Thursday. There are no wood
chips left from the ‘people’s stage’, no food-crusted pieces taken from
the aluminum trash can-turned soup cauldron.

Not only would I collect these pieces as the connective tissue that
bound the park together, I would build on the work of the Community Soil
Collection Project which has been working across the southern United
States to gather soil at historical lynching sites to display in large
jars at museums like the National Memorial for Peace and Justice.[^06Chapter4_44]
By linking the systemic past murders of African Americans with
modern-day soil, this archival work by the Equal Justice Initiative
challenges the ephemerality of these experiences. The blood of lynched
victims, even a century later, is symbolically embedded in the soil that
serves as the bedrock for contemporary societies. People’s Parks too
serve as palimpsests of centuries of colonization, histories of
immigration, as well as contemporary practices of displacement, police
brutality, and resistance. The soil of Berkeley’s People’s Park might
contain broken pieces of Ohlone pottery from the area’s indigenous
inhabitants, remnants from life on Spanish missions during Mexican rule,
bent nails from the affordable housing complex demolished on site in
1967, traces of the mudflat that infuriated locals after construction
stalled, ashes of hog roasts, particles of blood, sweat, and urine, and
torn bits of flyers and pamphlets that fell from the park’s collective
bulletin board on rainy days. The soil will contain histories of the
park since its first occupation: the sand of the riot-sparking
volleyball courts in 1991, traces of hundreds of vegan food giveaways
over the years by Food Not Bombs, as well as vestiges from thousands of
people over the past five decades that have made the park their literal
home as housing prices in the Bay area have skyrocketed.

While the design of Berkeley’s People’s Park has transformed numerous
times over the past five decades, the occupied soil itself maintains its
power as an archive of feelings about the relationship between space and
power. The insurgency with which parks were created transformed material
culture into what political ecologist Jane Bennett calls ‘vital
materiality‘, blurring borders between life and matter, human and
nonhuman, in ways that became a form of embodied consciousness raising.
Park creators often imagined the vacant lots they targeted as dead
wastelands—made empty, lifeless, and dangerous from housing demolition.
The plants they nourished and the objects they brought to and created
within parks were not only for utility, communication, and decoration,
but served as ‘vibrant matter‘ that enlivened lots and by extension the
communities displaced by demolitions. In this way, the objects placed
within parks not only created a politicized landscape entrenched in
urban environmental utopianism, but were imbued with their own ‘thing
power’ that allowed park goers to imagine their territorial placemaking
as procreative. The vitality of park materialities allowed park goers to
imagine themselves as biologically and emotionally connected with their
liberated landscapes in ways that have shaped the historical memory of
these political placemaking projects as childlike play spaces and sacred
grounds.

In a chapter on imagining nontraditional archives for queer figures like
organic farmer Elisa Gidlow, Greg Youmans dismisses the idea of taking
cuttings and seeds from Gidlow’s garden, arguing that removing plant
matter would ‘dehistoricize’ them by relocating them from the site to
the archive. Instead Youmans suggests using plant matter as a metaphor:

> The solstice seeds offer us a concept of history as an experience of
> generational connection based not on facts and substance but on the
> impermanence and mutability of matter. Perhaps we can develop an
> archival practice along similar lines, by understanding the papers
> stored in our collections not as cold records, or as what remains as
> and after people pass on, but instead as both recipes and main
> ingredients of the larger alchemical process that is queer
> history.[^06Chapter4_45]

What if similar to Gidlow’s own ‘plant-strewn messages’ that weaved
together poetry, letters, and autobiography, the archival materials of
people’s parks served as instructions ‘to graft the garden to the
archive as another site in which to nurture a connection with the
past’?[^06Chapter4_46] In this light, the seemingly bland paper-filled boxes
serving as the archives on people’s parks are not reflections but
recipes—carrying the idea that the relationship between space and power
can be reimagined in the present and future.
