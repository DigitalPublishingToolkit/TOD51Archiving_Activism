# 05. VIBRANT ARCHIVES: ARCHIVING AFGHAN EXILE ART AND ACTIVISM ON INSTAGRAM

### ANN-KATRINE SCHMIDT NIELSEN 

## Introduction

A video on Instagram shows a woman on a small ladder meticulously
pasting a green poster onto a Parisian street sign.[^07Chapter5_1] The poster
resembles the sign in layout, color, and graphics, but it carries
another name: *Allée du Commandant Massoud* is, according to the poster,
re-named *Allée de Frozan Saafi*. The substitution of the name of the
Afghan military commander, also known as the Lion of Panjshir, on four
street signs in central Paris for the names of four female Afghan
activists was a performance carried out by artist Kubra Khademi on the
30th of January 2022. It is documented, distributed, and archived on her
social media profiles on Twitter and Instagram. This is not the first
time Khademi, working with feminist and politically engaged art, employs
digital media as a central element in her work. In 2015 she walked the
streets of Kabul wearing armor with enhanced female forms, a public
performance that led to death threats and her subsequent migration to
France.[^07Chapter5_2] It was documented with a video camera and uploaded to
YouTube where it can still be found under its title *Armor.*[^07Chapter5_3]

Khademi is, sadly, not the only artist or activist who has been forced
to leave Afghanistan in the past years. The fall of Kabul on August 15,
2021, and the ensuing takeover by the Taliban set in motion another
period of mass-migration from the country and its capital in the late
summer of 2021. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) estimates that 2.6 million Afghans are currently living as
refugees while 3.5 million are internally displaced and The Artistic
Freedom Initiative, an organization devoted to assisting artists at risk
of persecution in their homelands to resettle elsewhere, reported that
they alone received almost 3,000 individual requests from Afghan artists
after the Taliban takeover.[^07Chapter5_4] Artists and activists are an especially
persecuted group under the Taliban regime that has, amongst other
things, beaten protesters, moved against the playing of music in public
spaces, and painted over murals in Kabul and other cities.[^07Chapter5_5] As Omaid
Sharifi, founder of ArtLords, an Afghan artivist grassroots movement,
says, ‘It is not possible for the Taliban to live with art’.[^07Chapter5_6]

This chapter investigates how three female exiled Afghan artists, Kubra
Khademi (b. 1989), Shamsia Hassani (b. 1988), and Rada Akbar (b. 1988),
all working with feminist issues and anti-war agendas, employ social
media as new distributional and archival spaces. In the chapter, I thus
ask: How do female Afghan artists use social media platforms,
specifically Instagram, to document, distribute, and archive artistic
and activist practices and performances?

I argue that in the turmoil of conflict and relocation Instagram
functions not only as a means of communicating with friends, family and
followers but also as an alternative deterritorialized exhibition space
and archive where site-specific and/or lost works and performances can
be shared and preserved in spite of their material destruction and their
institutional and cultural marginalization.

In the chapter, it is suggested that the social media platform is used
by the artists to fulfill three fundamental functions: 1) It documents
and distributes the work and protests of precarious activists, artists,
and groups, 2) it is used as an integral element in their aesthetic
practices, works, and performances, and 3) it provides the digital
infrastructure for the recording of lived experience and expressions of
affects in so-called archives of feeling.[^07Chapter5_7] Through the sampling of
digital texts and analyses of aesthetic works, communicative content and
archival practices, the chapter thus aims to show how artists employ
social media not only to *curate* and *circulate* expressions of Afghan
feminist art and activism, but also to *claim* and *reframe* the
cultural production of Afghan women’s voices and subject positions.[^07Chapter5_8]

## Context and theoretical framework

Afghanistan has been the scene of various wars and conflicts for the
larger part of the past four decades. In 2001, the US led alliance
invaded the country as a response to the 9/11 attacks and the Taliban’s
refusal to surrender the leaders of Al-Qaeda. The invasion turned into a
lengthy military operation in the country and The Costs of War project,
monitoring the human and economic costs of the post-9/11 wars, reports
more than 176,000 deaths caused directly by war in Afghanistan
alone.[^07Chapter5_9] The 20-year presence of American and allied forces came to an
end in August 2021 where the withdrawal of the remaining international
soldiers caused the panic scenes in the airport of Kabul which were
circulated globally by news media and on social media platforms. Many
Kabulis were desperate to escape the Taliban which took over the capital
and the country. Amongst those fleeing the new regime were members of
the Afghan art scene. They, thus, joined the group of exiled artists who
had already been forced to leave the country during the decades of
conflict and unrest.

Despite the grave sociopolitical context, Afghanistan has continued to
produce a wide range of popular cultural, traditional, and contemporary
artists and Kabul has – before August 2021 – been described as having a
small but ‘rich culture of artistic production’.[^07Chapter5_10] Certainly, a new
generation of artists working with street art, visual art, photography,
and performance art has seen the light of day and female artists such as
Kubra Khademi, Shamsia Hassani, Fatimah Hossaini, Malina Suliman, and
Rada Akbar are now gaining international recognition. Not much research
has been done on these Afghan artists and their aesthetic practices
though. Curator and arts consultant Jemima Montagu notes how the
international aid organizations have intervened, financially and
creatively, in the Afghan art scene and caused the widespread
instrumentalization of art.[^07Chapter5_11] Sociologist Bilquis Ghani has
investigated the pedagogy of public art – the street art of the
aforementioned Sharifi and Hassani, for example – and the use of art as
a space to produce counter-narratives in opposition to the widespread
islamophobia and stereotyping of Afghans in the Western cultural
imagination.[^07Chapter5_12] This chapter adds to this field knowledge of how
Afghan artists in exile employ social media platforms to reach a global
audience and to create and preserve artistic and activist practices.

Western stereotypes and expectations are certainly relevant to address
when working with female Afghan artists challenging social roles,
specifically those related to gender, in their work and using social
media to, as Ghani puts it, ‘offer counter-narratives to global
mainstream media’ and their depictions of Afghans.[^07Chapter5_13] The so-called
West has for a long time cultivated a certain orientalized image of
Afghan women as silent and subordinated beings to be saved.[^07Chapter5_14] The
burqa wearing woman has served as a legitimizing symbol of the continued
military presence in the country. International soldiers were in
Afghanistan, the story in Western media goes, to secure Afghan women’s
human rights and Afghan girls’ education. This intense preoccupation
with Afghan women and girls, however, has not created a sustained
interest in, or ability to listen to, the actual experiences and
opinions of these women in Western media publics. As Vera Mackie
concludes in her analysis of globally distributed photographic
representations of Afghan girls, ‘these representations position the
first-world viewer as active and articulate spectator and the
third-world woman (sic) as passive and silent sufferer’.[^07Chapter5_15] The three
contemporary female artists, through their continued practice, all
challenge this problematic dichotomy as well as local Afghan
expectations of what women can and ought to do.[^07Chapter5_16]

Accordingly, following Chantal Mouffe’s definition of critical art as
‘art that foments dissensus’ and aims ‘at giving voice to all those who
are silenced within the framework of the existing hegemony’, the
selected artists can all be said to work within a critical aesthetic
realm. According to Mouffe, critical art plays a decisive role in
challenging consensual views on society and in opening up possibilities
for ‘the construction of new subjectivities’.[^07Chapter5_17] As such, art becomes
a transformative vehicle for societal change in its ability to challenge
existing hegemonies and produce new perspectives on the social,
political, cultural, and economic order. Activist and art scholar
Stephen Duncombe, moreover, stresses that art is also an important
element in activist endeavors to change existing material realities
because it can *affect* its audience. The production of activist effects
goes through the aesthetic production of affective stimuli and, thus,
‘when it comes to stimulating social change, affect and effect are not
discrete ends but are all up in each other’s business’.[^07Chapter5_18] Even if one
can never be certain as to the outcome of the affective stimuli given by
a work of art, the activist artist can work towards one or more
transformational goals: change the way people think, feel, and talk
about a certain issue (cultural shifts/change) and/or effectuate
concrete material or structural change in the world (material
impact/result).[^07Chapter5_19]

Khademi, Akbar, and Hassani produce work critiquing the structures
pertaining to gender-based and geopolitical violence and
marginalization. Hence with Duncombe’s transformational goals in mind,
we can observe how they work towards long-term cultural and material
changes as they challenge sedimented social and political power
structures and perceptions of the world. Finally, Duncombe defines the
activist artist to be any ‘artist who hopes to bring about social,
economic or political change through art’.[^07Chapter5_20] This inclusive
definition of activism and activist art allows us to consider how the
three exiled artists are all engaged in feminist quests for the
transformation of societies and international relations through art. It
is, however, interesting to note that Khademi and Akbar offer seemingly
opposing reflections upon their roles as activists and artists in two
research-interviews I conducted with them in the fall of 2022. Khademi
stresses how she has always considered herself an artist. While
acknowledging the importance of activism, she resists the title of
activist since art is her primary medium of expression, adding ‘but I do
say, I am a feminist’. On the other hand, Akbar considers herself to be
first and foremost an activist since she has ‘chosen art as a tool to do
activism’, but also stresses the feminist goals of her work. Akbar
furthermore explains how, for her, social media are primarily tools for
her activism. I will continue to use the term activist artist – rather
than, e.g., activist, artivist, or political artist – throughout the
chapter to capture the flexibility and the productive tension inherent
in the compound term.

The merging of artistic measures and political ends is, of course, not
new. However, what has changed remarkably within the last decades is the
availability of digital technologies and platforms that can be used to
produce, distribute, and archive these artistic and activist practices.
Leah Lievrouw suggests four basic features are characteristic of new
media: they are interactive and (seemingly) ubiquitous; they evolve
through the recombination of existing media forms; and they promote a
networked organization of society and technology.[^07Chapter5_21] Through platforms
such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, users can share,
produce, promote, alter, and connect to relevant, and irrelevant, media
content at almost all times and places. This, MacDowall and Budge argue
in their work on Instagram and art, has significant implications for all
art professionals and artists: Instagram ‘embodies a new cultural logic
of the networked art image’.[^07Chapter5_22] However, I would add, it has
particular value and meaning for exiled artists who in the turmoil of
conflict and relocation can reach a diverse, geographically scattered
audience with works, opinions, and updates without the interference of
and dependency on cultural institutions, museums, and mainstream media.
The circumvention of traditional art institutions also opens for the
possibility that artists online can influence audiences who ‘highly
unlikely \[…\] will ever travel to such a place’ with their artistic
work.[^07Chapter5_23]

Since a basic affordance of the mentioned social media platforms is the
continued accumulation of content on personal profile pages, ordered in
reverse chronological order like the original blog format, it has been
suggested that we can understand social media as personal archives and
as taking part in forming an ‘archival culture’.[^07Chapter5_24] The relation
between social media and the concept of the archive is, however, one of
dispute and ambivalence. Social media are, for one thing, controlled
more by tech companies’ economic interests and algorithmic modulations
and by users’ personal and volatile ideas of what to post, how to post
it, and for how long to keep it, than by institutional endeavors to
serve public interests to preserve media texts for the future (as in the
case of the Internet Archive).[^07Chapter5_25] As such, conceptualizing social
media as forms of archival spaces might require, as David Beer contends,
that we are aware that these new ‘commercial’ archival spaces have ‘a
very different logic to the archives of the past’ and that we do not
over-stress the transparent, emancipatory, and democratic potential of
this form of idiosyncratic social media archiving.[^07Chapter5_26] One way to work
with the artists’ social media profiles as ambivalent cultural memory
spaces is to adhere to the distinction between ‘recordmaking’ and
‘recordkeeping’ suggested by Rebecka Taves Sheffield. She contends that
while recordmaking (‘the use of any kind of media to communicate to
others information about an individual or collective experience or
action’) is an inherent part of recordkeeping, recordkeeping also
entails the practice of ensuring ‘that records are authentic and
reliable, have integrity, and are usable in the present and a potential
future state’.[^07Chapter5_27] Thus, even if social media are
recordmaking-technologies, they are, according to Sheffield, harder to
conceptualize as recordkeeping-spaces since there are no agents and
infrastructure to ensure media texts’ preservation in a fixed and
retrievable form for future use. Sheffield’s distinction is useful when
working with the records of activist and artist practices online.
However, the distinction relies on a formalized practice of keeping
records that is often not possible to conduct and/or maintain in loosely
defined, informal, emergent, and less mature or less formally organized
social movements.[^07Chapter5_28]

As such, I recognize that, at least from an archivist point of view,
social media are not platforms fit to fulfil the recordkeeping functions
of the traditional, or *proper*, archive but also suggest that often
these unordered and unorderly records are all that we are left with in
the cultural memory work regarding activist artists’ practices online.
Furthermore, as the analysis will show, the three artists do often show
an acute awareness of not only making but also of *keeping* records such
as artworks, activist communication, and prosaic media texts which is
why I, despite all theoretical and practical reservations, will continue
to use the terms ‘archive’ and ’archiving’. We might view the artists’
profiles as informal, vibrant, and with Levey, ‘*de facto*’ archives of
artistic-activist oeuvres which would otherwise risk both destruction
(due, for example, to the momentary and extra-institutional character or
the site-specific and vulnerable materiality of the artworks) and
cultural oblivion (due to the peripheral position of the exiled activist
artist and the ensuing ‘institutional neglect’).[^07Chapter5_29] These archival
spaces are inherently unstable and vibrating with the unfolding of the
global, local, and personal crises of migration and war. To the extent
that they question the in- and exclusions of institutional archival
processes and the hegemonic production of knowledge, they can be likened
to counter-archives found in unexpected places and forming ‘a collection
of absences: the documents that are not collected or do not exist’
elsewhere.[^07Chapter5_30] Such peripheral, sometimes dissident, digital archives
are, according to Arjun Appadurai, often of great significance to
migrants and exiled groups since they not only present ‘a guide to the
uncertainties of identity-building under adverse conditions’, but also
allow for the construction of a counter-narrative to the dominant
‘narratives of public memory in the new home of the migrant, where the
migrant is frequently seen as a person with only one story to tell – the
story of abject loss and need’.[^07Chapter5_31]

To flesh out these differential functions of the informal, vibrant
social media archiving, I turn to Merrill et al. who, in their work on
social movements’ use of digital media, suggest that there are three
fundamental clusters of media practices to be found in online memory
work: curation (i.e. documentation, selection, display), circulation,
and claiming.[^07Chapter5_32] We may consider the profiles of the three activist
artists as alternative exhibition spaces functioning both to *collect*
and *curate* artistic work, processes, and performances and to
*circulate* professional communication, political messages, personal
perspectives, and intimate emotions. Finally, I argue, the artists also
re-*claim* and reframe the discursive stereotyping of Afghanistan and
‘the Afghan woman’ through their construction of an activist-aesthetic
archive of images, performances, feelings, and protests.

## Method

Even if most of these practices are carried out across platforms, I will
focus on the Instagram profiles of Kubra Khademi, Shamsia Hassani, and
Rada Akbar. Instagram has been chosen because it is the platform where
all three artists have most followers (compared to Facebook and Twitter)
and because it prioritizes visual content, which makes it an interesting
place to investigate the distribution and recording of activist
art.[^07Chapter5_33] All three artists have public, open-access profiles and all
seem to consider the media content shared on the platform public rather
than private; witness their bio texts, which all emphasize professional
identities and contact information. Informed consent to use the media
texts for research has, nevertheless, been obtained directly from Akbar
and Khademi and Hassani’s manager. While Akbar and Hassani each have one
profile under their own name, Khademi has two – one solely dedicated to
art and one with a more mixed content. The following table provides an
overview of the profiles:[^07Chapter5_34]

  **Username**         **Active since**   **Number of followers**   **Number of posts**   **Bio text**
  ---------------- -------------- --------------------- ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  radaakbar        10.2012        9,970                 396               Conceptual artist. Photographer. Founder @abarzanan. www.abarzanan.com

  kubra\_khademi   04.2019        8,130                 254               Multidisciplinary artist from Afghanistan / based in Paris, France / Contact @galerieericmouchet
  khademikubra     11.2015        7,204                 968               Multidisciplinary Artist / From Afghanistan / Based in Paris, France / 2^nd^ Instagram : @kubra\_khademi
  
<br/>

When considering that some of the most followed Instagram accounts have
300-500 million followers, the artists’ number of followers – except
maybe for Hassani’s 256,000 – might not seem spectacular. However, for
an upcoming artist, reaching a potential audience of 7,000-9,000 people
with each artwork posted can represent not only a significant increase
with respect to the number of people expected to attend traditional
smaller scale art exhibitions but also in terms of audience diversity.
Characteristic of all three artists’ profiles is the fact that they
appeal to an international audience (comments include ones in English,
Dari, French, and Spanish), which means that the artists can use
Instagram to reach a global cohort of people interested in, for example,
art, Afghanistan, feminism and/or activism. Furthermore, all three
artists use English in most posts to address this globally scattered
audience. Writing as a European citizen, I am part of the heterogenous
social media audience that the media texts address. In the following
analysis, I will focus on the content shared by the artists themselves.
This qualitative approach has been chosen to analyze ‘the specific ways
in which artists use or understand the Instagram platform’ as a
distributional and archival space.[^07Chapter5_35]

In terms of sampling, I will work with posts publicized between August
2021 and October 2022. This period has been chosen with reference to the
Taliban takeover in August 2021. On this occasion, Hassani and Akbar
were forced to leave the country that Khademi had already fled. The
reinstatement of the Taliban regime presents both a personal moment of
upheaval for the artists and an international crisis. In the aftermath,
the artists have in different ways utilized their profiles and artworks
to speak up against Taliban and geopolitical power relations as well as
to raise awareness of the continued humanitarian and political crises in
Afghanistan. The artists posted, in total, 300 times on Instagram in the
period studied: Hassani 79, Khademi 176 on her primary and 29 on her
secondary profile, and Akbar 16; I will also address Khademi and Akbar’s
use of the story function. The posts present a variety of content with a
majority focusing on recording artistic processes, presenting finished
artworks, and promoting upcoming exhibitions. I will use my analysis,
however, to show the different types of recordmaking and recordkeeping
carried out on the four social media accounts: the documentation of
site-specific and/or destroyed art works, the creation and circulation
of critical performances, and the use of digital texts as repositories
of feeling. I will focus on one function in each of the three artists’
online practices, this structuring device, however, does not mean that
all three do not use the platform for *curation and documentation*,
*creation and circulation*, and *re-claiming*.

## Analysis

#### Documenting disappearing lines of flight

On September 16, 2021, street artist and former art lecturer at Kabul
University Shamsia Hassani posted two pictures and a text on her
Instagram profile (fig. 5.1). The first picture is split in two and
shows a ‘before’: a mural of a woman with a burqa-like head-attire but a
bared neck and a red, glittering heart on top of her black dress, and an
’after’: a whitewashed wall. The second picture shows the artist next to
her work at some point before its erasure. Hassani’s text – in both
English and Dari – informs the audience of what they are
witnessing:[^07Chapter5_36]

> I just received this image after the arrival of T aliban \[sic\]. They
> painted over one of my graffitis in Kabul. Probably they painted over
> my other murals in the city as well (I still don’t have any pictures
> of them). \[…\] I never imagined that our world will suddenly fall and
> we will never get to the day that I was waiting for.[^07Chapter5_37]

The post documents Hassani’s site-specific street art piece and
circulates it among a large digital audience – it has more than 56,000
likes and 2,600 comments. It also documents the gradual disappearance
and erasure of existing urban art *in situ* in Kabul and, thus,
pinpoints the immediate necessity for the artists to develop
self-reflexive strategies for preserving their own work online.

  ![Fig. 5.1. ‘Mural. Before/After’ (@shamsiahassani, 16.09.2021), with the
permission of Shamsia Hassani.](imgs/5.1.png)

<br/>

The Taliban’s infamous practice of painting over murals has been covered
widely by global news media. To a regime reacting violently to forms of
dissidence, Hassani’s mural might present a specifically problematic
envisioning of feminist liberation. In the artwork, located in a Kabul
residential area, the woman’s burqa-like veil is cut or unraveled at the
beginning of her neck, but a red zigzagging line – a loose thread? –
continues from the burqa through the heart, which is broken in two by
the same line, mirroring pop cultural depictions of a broken heart. The
piece could, thus, be taken to depict the heartbreak resulting from
being forced into certain types of garments and womanhood, or the
invisibility of female individuality, ache, pain, and sorrow hid,
literally and figuratively, under the hyper visibility of the burqa.
Read as such, the piece critiques both conservative gender norms and
coalitional governments’ and international help organizations’
preoccupations with the burqa as a metonymy of all Afghan women.[^07Chapter5_38]
The mural unmistakably resembles Hassani’s general style and graffiti
works which all depict large female figures with closed eyes, elongated
lashes, and no mouths. They often wear colorful clothes and hold flowers
or musical instruments and present poetic pockets of resistance in
cityscapes characterized by the imminent danger of gendered and
geopolitical violence.[^07Chapter5_39] The absence of the mouth, the traditional
instrument of democratic participation and self-assertion, may confound
some viewers: Are these female figures not able or allowed to ‘speak up’
or ‘speak for themselves’? Hassani has however, in an interview,
connected the absent mouths in her female figures to the empowering
features of musical instruments and the non-verbal language of music:
‘She can use musical instruments to talk with people, to speak louder
and \[get\] more attention, as she has no mouth. But the musical
instrument gives her power to speak in society’.[^07Chapter5_40] This paradox
suggests a dismantling of the traditional discourses of power: to speak
efficiently in and against a militarized society, these women use
another language than the one used by male politicians, military
commanders, insurgents, soldiers, diplomats, and NGO-workers. In
Deleuzian terms we may thus conceive of these murals as lines of flight,
‘those parts of an assemblage that escape the structure of which they
are a part’.[^07Chapter5_41] Speaking and connecting through the language of music,
poetry, and art, rather than politics, war, and economics, these murals
work to break down the gendered structure of public space and discourse
in Afghanistan and to point to transformational modes of relating and
‘speaking’.

In Hassani’s post mourning their disappearance, the short explanatory
text is followed by a range of hashtags which categorize the media text
according to content (\#mural, \#graffiti, \#painting, \#wall), time and
place (\#homeland, \#kabul, \#afghanistan, \#warzone, \#2021), and
sender (\#artist, \#afghanartist, \#homeless). Hashtags generally
function as tools of categorization and as contextual guidance to
readers’ interpretation of a media text.[^07Chapter5_42] This is also the case for
Hassani who, by tagging, connects her work to the broad
categories/catalogs used on Instagram, especially those relating to art
and graffiti, and thus makes it visible to more users exploring the
platform’s content. The last tag, \#homeless, in particular, carries
with it an affective poignancy that suggests the isolation of exile and
the despair of watching the destruction from afar. The fact that Hassani
received the ‘after’-image from someone in Kabul indicates that other
people in the city care enough for the piece to document its destruction
and partake in the recording and continued virtual preservation of the
mural. This act of care shows that even if Hassani’s work is being
materially destroyed, it has made a lasting imprint on some Kabulis.
However, thanks to social media, the piece’s afterlife does not solely
rely on the memories of Kabul residents. According to MacDowall and de
Souza, writing on how Instagram has reshaped graffiti and street art,
the act of sharing the erased work online ‘gives it a second life in
which images circulate among a community of interest’.[^07Chapter5_43] In the case
of street art, a site specific and easily destructible form of critical
art, social media has radically changed the possible reach and
preservation of these statements of dissidence. At the same time,
however, Hassani subtly points out another kind of precarity surrounding
these digital ghosts of urban art living on in the virtual spaces of
Instagram when she writes ‘T aliban’ rather than ‘Taliban’ in the posted
text. In the time around the Taliban takeover several Muslim social
media users experienced having their content and even accounts removed
if they used words such as ‘Taliban’ as they were seen to promote a
dangerous organization by the platform’s algorithm.[^07Chapter5_44] Hassani tries
to avoid the censoring algorithm by inserting a blank space into the
‘perilous’ word and thereby also makes the audience aware of the doubled
perils of censorship surrounding her work. Not only are her physical
murals being painted over, but their digital traces are also in danger
of being deleted by the very communication platform to which she turns
in order to document and preserve them. This problem becomes even more
evident when we turn to Kubra Khademi’s performative challenges to the
exclusionary logics of both the traditional archive and the social media
platforms themselves.

#### Creating and circulating change

In the introduction, I touched upon the performance *Les Héroïnes
d’aujourd’hui* where Khademi showed support for four Afghan women’s
rights activists – Frozan Saafi, Fowzia Wahdat, Hoda Kamoosh, and
Rokhshana Rezai – by pasting their names over the name of Ahmad Shah
Massoud, Afghan military commander and resistance leader, on street
signs in Paris. Khademi was later invited to recreate the performance in
Roubaix where she honored other activists by the same means. The act of
substituting masculine singularity with female multiplicity displays the
militarized and masculinized norms of public spaces in Afghanistan as
well as in Europe where most public buildings, streets, and squares are
still named after male leaders and military victors. As such, Khademi’s
performance directly revolts against the exclusion of women – especially
Muslim women – from the archive of publicly honored persons. Khademi had
invited *Le Figaro* to report from the happening itself.[^07Chapter5_45] Their
reportage was published the following day and ‘demonstrates the
continued importance of established media for the diffusion of images of
activism’.[^07Chapter5_46] However, the performance was also recorded with a mobile
phone camera by one of Khademi’s accomplices. These recordings show
Khademi’s deed in the deserted park on a crisp January morning, and they
were distributed and stored on Khademi’s Instagram profile along with
the article, close-up pictures of the street signs, and portraits of the
four women. The social media texts not only document but add material,
information, and perspectives to the performance itself, unavailable to
any ‘audience’ accidentally present in the park, to such a degree that
one might ask what the actual artwork is: the live performance or the
subsequent distribution and digital collection of documents, videos, and
pictures? According to performance scholar Philip Auslander, this kind
of performance documentation traditionally belongs to the theatrical
(producing events for/through forms of documentation), rather than the
documentary (recording evidence of the occurrence of an event), since it
not only records a previous performance, but – due to the lack of an
original audience except for the reporter, the camera operator, and
by-passers – actually ‘becomes the only space in which the performance
occurs’ for the broader audience.[^07Chapter5_47] Auslander further questions the
ontological distinction between performance and document when he
concludes that ‘the act of documenting an event as a performance is what
constitutes it as such’.[^07Chapter5_48] The constitutive role of recordings and
media texts is evident in Khademi’s work where they not only function as
documentational traces but as performative elements in the activist
artwork itself. The transgressive performance needs the recording eye to
become something other than a sheer act of vandalism, to become art.
*Les héroïnes* exemplifies the power of art to alter existing realities,
if only for a while, and the integral role that media, and especially
social media, play in its creation and distribution.

Khademi also shares more personal and explicitly activist messages,
campaigns, and happenings on her profile. In the wake of a suicide
bombing in Kabul killing more than 50 Hazara students, mostly young
girls, Khademi used the story function, a newer function on Instagram
allowing profile holders to share content for a shorter period of time
before it disappears, to share information on the bombing, display
personal portraits of some of the girls, and spread the hashtag
\#StopHazaraGenocide to help mobilize international political awareness
of the persecution of the Hazara minority in Afghanistan. Unless they
are saved by profile holders as so-called ‘highlights’, stories
disappear from the profile after 24 hours.[^07Chapter5_49] They thus function more
as a tool for mobilization and awareness-raising than for archiving and
indicate the instability of the social media records.

Another aspect to consider when working with social media as a vibrant
but instable form of archive is the interference and modulations of the
platforms themselves mentioned earlier. With her direct form of
expression and transgressive art practice, Khademi seems to have
encountered the regulative power of the platform on several occasions.
One such encounter was during a residency in the US where she posted a
selfie flipping off the camera.[^07Chapter5_50] The text explained her contempt for
President Biden who days before had ordered the redirection of billions
of dollars of Afghanistan’s frozen funds to American victims of terror:

> Biden! you are the worst US president afghans have ever seen, after
> all the shit you did, now how could you take the \$3,5 Billions of
> Afghan’s money to the victims of 9/11famili\[e\]s? \[…\] Feeling:
> vomiting up on your banks Biden, Fuck you![^07Chapter5_51]

The original post was removed by Instagram. Khademi, however, reposted
not only the original picture but also the entire communication behind
the removal in which Instagram, in a standard communication formula,
informed Khademi of community guidelines. By reposting screenshots of
the original post as well as Instagram’s request, Khademi makes an
obvious statement against Instagram guidelines to which she refuses to
adhere. However, the post also becomes a testament to the fragility of
online archives of dissidence. At any point, the media platform may
decide to censor, block, or even permanently ban users, thus stripping
them not only of their online presence but also of access to and control
over their personal records. By reposting her outcry, Khademi not only
critiques exploitative geopolitical economic structures but also
technosocial infrastructures that are referring her and others without
the support of institutions such as national media, archives, and
museums to the instable self-archiving at the mercy of global tech
companies.

## Re-Claiming the everyday through the archive

The analysis so far has primarily focused on the way Instagram presents
promising and problematic spaces for the circulation and archiving of
activist art by exiled artists. In this last part, however, I am going
to focus on how the social media profile also can become an archive of
feelings and space for reclaiming the memory of the lost home. According
to Ann Cvetkovich marginalized publics constituted around trauma often
‘challenges common understandings of what constitutes an archive’.[^07Chapter5_52]
This means that lesbian, queer, or diaspora archives – to mention just
some of the alternatives to the dominant national archive – take an
unusual and ephemeral form and provide a different kind of memory-based
and affective knowledge about the past. ‘These publics’, Cvetkovich
argues, ‘are hard to archive because they are lived experiences, and the
cultural traces they leave are frequently inadequate to the task of
documentation’.[^07Chapter5_53]

Turning once again to the ephemeral stories on Instagram, I argue that
these actually can come to constitute a central part of the vibrant
archive of exile. This is the case when the profile holder chooses to
save and display the stories on their profile by turning them into
collections of ‘highlights’. Any highlighted stories are accessible to
other users at the top of the individual profile page. The stories
default temporary character means that their contents are often more
prosaic and their aesthetics rawer than the polished pictures posted on
the profiles of Instagram.[^07Chapter5_54] The stories remind us of Instagram’s
original endeavor to be a platform for instant visual communication[^07Chapter5_55]
– a market function which other applications such as Snapchat and BeReal
has largely captured. Profile holders can categorize their highlighted
stories according to subjectively meaningful categories, and on the
profile of photographer and conceptual artist Rada Akbar we find the
five categories ‘Press’, ‘Paris’, ‘AFG’, ‘Food’, and ‘Home•Plants’.

The category ‘AFG’ is of special interest since it contains almost 100
pictures and short film clips from Afghanistan.[^07Chapter5_56] The highlighted
and, thus, preserved stories all show different aspects of the artist’s
everyday life in Afghanistan: food, trips, selfies, views, shops, cats,
citizens, etc. The story function, thus, provides a digital
infrastructure for the archiving of affectively meaningful moments of
everyday life. In contrast to the monumentality of the artwork and the
transformational vigor and critical stance of the activist campaigns,
they are transient testaments to a lived experience and pervasive
feelings of love, loss, and grief as they provide re-views of what has
been lost. The affective tonality of the AFG-archive is enhanced by the
last element in the story-collection which is a short video where the
camera zooms in on a large Afghan flag on top of a hill. This, the
tricolor flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, was immediately
replaced by the white flag of the Taliban movement and the Islamic
Emirate of Afghanistan at the Taliban’s takeover, but still functions as
a sign of dissidence and disagreement with the Taliban regime; for
example, on social media where users post pictures of it or use it next
to their profile names. Viewing the video is deeply affected by the
inescapable knowledge that this is one of the last times Akbar would
enjoy this specific view of her home. The text accompanying the footage
underlines the loss and attests to the trauma of war and migration:
‘today was the worst day in my life! my beloved Afghanistan collapsed
before my eyes 💔 💔 💔’.[^07Chapter5_57] The highlighted story in words and action
marks the end of Akbar’s living archive of Afghanistan and the beginning
of her life in exile. In Akbar’s stories, and in many other scattered
digital records, however, exiled Afghans can re-view and remember the
intimately known landscapes of their home country.

At the same time, the highlighted stories serve to re-claim the cultural
imagining of Afghanistan. For those followers unfamiliar with
Afghanistan as anything other than the tragic subject of news media and
political discourse, the stories provide an unknown insight into
everyday life in the Afghanistan and Kabul that existed prior to August
2021. The AFG-collection of stories shows an everyday life absent in
most Western media representations of a war-ridden and deprived country
from the handheld camera’s affectively engaging first-person point of
view. As such, Akbar’s archive of stories claims and reframes memories
of the home country and, even if they are not explicitly critical or
activist, they provide a means of restructuring and transforming the
media induced view of Afghanistan. They become an affectively powerful
part of the counter-archive formed by the artists’ perpetual digital
recordmaking and recordkeeping.

## Conclusion

The analysis has shown how the three Afghan activist artists not only
self-reflexively partake in making records for the future, but also
actively seek to preserve and keep these records on their social media
profiles. Whether it is through the documentation of site-specific,
destroyed and/or performative pieces, the challenge to political and
platform censorship, and/or through the self-aware recording and
stor(y)ing of glimpses of lost everyday life, the three female artists
all partake in shaping and preserving records of their lives, works, and
experiences as exiled Afghan female artists. The Instagram profiles can,
thus, be viewed as a means of producing a counter-archive vibrating with
agency, art, affect, and activism and rupturing mainstream media
framings of Afghan women as the silent and passively suffering symbols
of Western warfare. But, these ambivalent cultural memory spaces also
fundamentally challenge our understandings of the longevity and
stability of the traditional archive. Instagram profiles are, certainly,
not eternal and the records made and kept on this platform are
vulnerable due to the dependency on commercial tech companies and the
continued investments and evaluations of the activist artists. Instead
of disregarding the prosaic but highly self-conscious recordmaking and
recordkeeping performed by the three artists on Instagram as not forming a
*proper* archive, we might see it as an invitation to think more about
practices than institutions, that is about supplementary forms of
*archiving* rather than *archives*. Archiving can no longer be viewed as
a disinterested activity performed solely by dedicated institutions and
as such it is important to acknowledge and analyze how social agents
partake in archiving, that is recordmaking and recordkeeping, activities
on a daily basis with the means, technologies, and platforms available.

The three Instagram profiles can, thus, be said to function as vibrant
*de facto* archives where art, activism, and affects are documented,
preserved, and circulated, and agency, subject positions, and memories
of Afghanistan are reclaimed. The analysis of the artists’ social media
practices teaches us at least three things about the potentials and
problems of viewing Instagram as an archival space for art activism: 1)
Social media can function as a site of collaborative archival work where
dissident art is circulated and preserved despite material destruction
or loss. This is an especially pertinent feature of social media
archiving for exiled artists having lost access to and control over any
works left in their home country. 2) Social media are constitutive not
only as documentational spaces but also as performative platforms for
creating and circulating critical art. This makes such critical works
vulnerable to external interests and platform regulations. However, as
Kubra Khademi has shown, these works can also effectively critique and
question the infrastructures and exclusionary powers referring artists
and activists to the unstable and vibrant archiving on Instagram. 3)
Social media archives question what the traditional archive must and can
contain. New technological functions provide new possibilities for the
preservation of the prosaic and the affectively meaningful of lived
experience.

For activist artists, turning to social media hold promises of reaching
a broader audience, of curatorial self-determination, of creative
experimentation, and of ensuring documentation and recording of their
work for the immediate future, but the problems of control, regulation,
and access must not be forgotten. Instagram is a flawed *de facto*
archive acting as stand-in to the exiled and marginalized agent. To
preserve these works and voices beyond the tech company-controlled
platforms and for the generations to come the exiled artists’ critical
testaments to conflict, gender inequalities, and geopolitics must *also*
be included, recorded, and kept by (digital) archives controlled not by
the need to make profit, but by the archival promise to document and
preserve for the future.

    currently being kept by an institution (museum or archive) or
    organization (grassroots or State), it does not mean that archivists
    are blind to the challenges of archiving Afghan lives, experiences,
    and movements. Archivist Moska Rokay has, for example, argued for
    the need to create digital archives ‘with oral histories and digital

    themselves’. See Moska Rokay, ‘Critical Ethnography as an Archival

[^07Chapter5_38]: It is important to note that Hassani is not partaking in a
    general, often Western led, move to unveil all Muslim women, on the
    contrary, her own figures continue to wear a more or less
    traditional head scarf covering their hair. See Lilia Abu-Lughod,
