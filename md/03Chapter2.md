# 02. BAK.MA: THE MAKING OF AN ACTIVIST DIGITAL MEDIA ARCHIVE

### ÖZGE ÇELIKASLAN

Independent, non-institutional archiving practice has been both
informally and officially regarded as a criminal act in many conflict
countries, including Turkey. Having a complex relationship with
archiving, some governments forbid and ban any non-sanctioned archival
attempts. For instance, in countries like Turkey that have a history of
military coups/regimes, state-led discrimination and oppression target
dissident communities. The aim is often to annihilate the political
memory of leftist, autonomous, and liberation movements, and these
efforts have, at times, been met with considerable success. However,
despite the oppression, people and collectives have come together around
documenting political movements, truth-seeking, and justice struggles to
generate their own digital archives as part of their activism over the
last decade. These archival infrastructures emerged in response to a
variety of sociopolitical needs, including the preservation and
circulation of archival material, provision of a social space, advocacy
of human rights, and supply of evidence for justice struggles. The level
of political oppression, social and historical factors, the strength of
dissent, and the cultural connotations of recordkeeping in these
countries determine the archiving processes of activists. In this
chapter, I examine these phenomena within the scope of *bak.ma digital
media archive of social movements* that appeared in Turkey during the
Gezi Park protests in 2013.

## The emergence of bak.ma

The story of the emergence of bak.ma can be told in three phases, taking
into account political and social conditions in Turkey over the past
decade, and how they were transformed by the Gezi Park protests and
their aftermath. The first phase was the emergence of bak.ma as an idea
during the protests in 2013; one of the significant features of bak.ma
is its attachment to the movement during its entire life cycle. The
second phase corresponded to the development of the digital archive in
2014. The third phase involved the expansion of its content beyond the
Gezi Park collection from 2015. In this contribution I will elaborate on
the methods and modes of collecting the footage of bak.ma and how
traditional and hegemonic forms of data collecting are regenerated in
this archive practice; and I look at how new meanings and alliances
emerge through the associations of the production processes in the
digital archival work through the division of labor, collective data
processing, transversal relations among people and groups, and affect. I
use my experiences from 2013 until today as a resource for this along
with those of the members of the video activist collectives who created
and developed bak.ma, namely Videoccupy, vidyokolektif, and Artıkişler
(referred to as ‘we’).

I was living in Istanbul when the Gezi Park protest was initiated. In
its first days, before the citizens occupied Gezi Park on June 1, I
recorded clashes between the protesters and the police with my handycam
at different places around Taksim Square. Then, I met two other friends
recording the events with various devices, and on June 2, we decided to
come together to form a video activist collective. In response to the
occupation of the public space, we named our collective Videoccupy,
which also corresponded to the occupation of the video medium. Twelve
people formed the collective, but many other people – friends and
colleagues with different backgrounds, but also video activists,
filmmakers, artists, and designers – joined us to record the mass
protests, police response, and daily life of the commune that sprang up
in Gezi Park, from the day the citizens occupied it until the evening
the police attacked, burned the tents, and brutally removed protestors
two weeks later, on June 15.

Videoccupy had set itself the goal of documenting the peaceful intent of
the resistance movement which was trying to keep open the public space.
As collective members, we created our own media to reveal police
violence toward protestors exercising their democratic rights but being
portrayed in the mainstream Turkish media as offensive, unfair, and
predatory ‘looters’ (*çapulcular*), as designated by Prime Minister
Erdoğan. We shot and edited short videos and shared them on our YouTube
page[^04Chapter2_1] and circulated the links through social media accounts and
email groups.

Videoccupy members thus came together to realize a unique project, one
that also differed from various those of other media groups[^04Chapter2_2] that
emerged to broadcast the news from the protesters’ perspective.[^04Chapter2_3] We
recorded the resistance with video activist tools and tactics. We split
into groups. Some of us recorded daily life at the park[^04Chapter2_4] while others
recorded demonstrations on Istiklal Street, rallies in Taksim Square,
and clashes on streets, boulevards, and squares at different locations
of Istanbul.

Many protestors also recorded the events on their mobile phones,
tablets, and handycams. We decided to collect these recordings when we
realized that the resistance would become a milestone event in the
country’s history, but we had other reasons as well. We could not go to
every protest, event, and meeting, and we could not record the events in
other cities and towns; many people recorded those events and deleted
their videos after sharing them on social media. We anticipated that
protestors’ recordings will be lost sooner or later. Live broadcasting
was another form widely used by the activists, and it was also one of
the effective tools of Gezi Park media. Although effective at the time
of the incident, it does not have an afterlife due to the disappearance
of the link, pages, and the effectiveness of the moment. Thus, almost
all live broadcasting collectives themselves disappeared right after the
resistance. Therefore, we aimed to rescue these recordings by assembling
them on a platform.

We wrote a call and circulated it via our networks. From the earliest
days of the protests to the end of the occupation and its aftermath,
Videoccupy repeatedly announced its project to the public. The first
call was made on June 4.[^04Chapter2_5] Following the call, we received recordings
from the people who attended protests and shot their testimonies with
their devices. At the same time, we collected video recordings in Gezi
Park at the shared booth of activist collectives.

Eventually, we aimed to create an open-access video archive of the Gezi
Park protests comprising all this collected material. Meanwhile, rushing
about from one place to another, we discussed making this collection
available to the public as soon as possible. Indeed, many journalists,
researchers, and filmmakers were trying to reach us to access the
collected material. Access to the collection needed to be immediate, so
we endeavored to find the most efficient form. Our initial idea was to
copy hard drives and leave copies at the buildings of the Taksim
Solidarity Platform and Chamber of Architects.

With a mission similar to that of the Occupy Wall Street Archives
Working Group (OWS), we wanted to own our resistance by keeping its
records and guaranteeing that our history would be accessible to the
public. Kylie Message emphasizes the role of the OWS archive as ‘the
main instrument of resistance and the main vehicle through which they
advocated for the Occupy movement’.[^04Chapter2_6] Message remarks that the
majority of the Occupy Wall Street collection was transferred to the
Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives located at New York
University between 2013 and 2017. Similarly, we also believed that
Videoccupy’s archive would be a major resource for the public by
offering a record of the protests. However, we did not want to hand over
the collection to an institutional library or an archive as we preferred
to stay independent and autonomous.

We acknowledged the practice of publicizing the collection as remission,
which means giving the recordings back to the people and returning the
memories of the resistance to the collection’s owners. Accordingly, we
researched different possibilities for public accessibility. A physical
location seemed easy and practical at first. However, since we were
dealing with a digital collection, it required a basic categorization on
the hard drives. The video files on hard drives could only be organized
by date, time, or place or by the content of the events in many
subfolders, which would complicate the process for users and also us.
Since there would only be a limited search engine, users would not be
able to easily find what they were looking for. Therefore, we decided to
look for cloud storage options.

We consulted with IT specialists and software developers and learned
that cloud storage would not be possible for several reasons. AWS
Storage Service was the most easily accessible and widely used cloud
storage. It belongs to Amazon, the American multinational technology
company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and
artificial intelligence. Amazon is one of the biggest IT companies,
alongside Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. These companies
effectively govern the internet: Amazon runs e-commerce, Apple has the
hardware, Meta controls social networking, and Microsoft dominates
business software.[^04Chapter2_7] Cloud storage accessibility, reliability, and
safety seemed unconvincing because of their centralized data collection
system, and we further estimated that cloud storage would become
financially difficult because of its over costing service. Most
importantly, security would be a problem. After long discussions,
therefore, we decided not to use cloud options because of their
connection with the internet monopoly.

Meanwhile, we discovered Pad.ma,[^04Chapter2_8] an online archive of text-annotated
video material, footage, and unfinished films from India. We were
impressed by Pad.ma because its entire collection is searchable,
viewable online, and free to download. The archive is based on
pan.do/ra,[^04Chapter2_9] an open-source media archive software. As the creators of
Pad.ma explain,[^04Chapter2_10] the archival design allows for various possible
types of viewing and contextualization, from an overview of themes and
timelines through much closer readings of transcribed dialogue and
geographical locations to layers of writing on the image material. In
addition, archive users can upload video files and enter descriptions,
keywords, and other annotations to be placed on the timelines. Creating
an organized online public archive would be difficult considering the
dynamism of the period and our conditions as we were at the first stage
of publicizing an activist video collection.

It took a long time to start using pan.do/ra because, immediately after
the police evacuated Gezi Park, the collective’s structure also changed.
We left our temporary office near the park, and some members returned to
their jobs. However, those who were still willing to record the
aftermath of Gezi documented various forms of ongoing protests, such as
the park forums, NGO press releases, mass gatherings to stand against
the brutality and human rights violations committed by the police, and
commemorations for the protestors who lost their lives during the
protests.[^04Chapter2_11]

The group split into two subgroups that kept collaborating while working
on different tasks for a few more months. Along with maintaining our
internal communication, filming on site, collecting protester’s footage
via online transfer services: these were our main activities in the
first phase of bak.ma. Before recounting the second phase, the
intertwinement of collective action in Gezi Park and the emergence of
bak.ma should be clarified.

<br/>

The Gezi commune should be conceived as an amorphous, bigger collective
body that included smaller collectivities and networks. People
spontaneously gathered and formed collectives in the park, mobilizing
and sharing information about the resistance process, maintaining safety
and solidarity, initiating councils and neighborhood assemblies, and
disseminating press releases and news from the inside within
non-hierarchical, autonomous, gender-inclusive, and non-discriminatory
structures. These collectivities created the ‘Gezi spirit’. McGarry et
al. claim that the ‘Gezi spirit denotes the enactment of solidarity
rather than a collective identity so that performing solidarity is
created through different voices being heard’.[^04Chapter2_13] Those different
voices were heard via their resistance and solidarity in action but also
via social media and the protestors’ dedicated Gezi media.[^04Chapter2_14] Gezi
media was an important part of the Gezi commune. Countless alternative
media platforms appeared in various forms during the protests, in
guerrilla television channels as well as live video form, through video
activist groups,[^04Chapter2_15] and via newspapers, journals, radio stations,
social media platforms, blogs, and webpages. News, videos, and
photographs from the park were circulated from the perspective of the
communers.

Video activism aims to unveil sociopolitically disregarded and neglected
incidents, people, and phenomena. Thus, activist media, specifically
video activism, was recognized for the first time in Turkey during the
Gezi Park protests. Ülkü Doğanay and İlkay Kara offer three main reasons
for this: 1) mainstream media was not the only source of information for
citizens 2) video activism made the demands of the protestors more
visible, and 3) it gave crucial encouragement to citizens to
participate.[^04Chapter2_16]

The multiple video activisms that emerged and spread during the Gezi
Park protests portrayed a multitude of oppositional voices. The video
activist documentation also provided images that were legally admissible
as evidence. The evidential value of the footage was acknowledged both
during and after the protests. At the time, it constituted a partial
control mechanism over state brutality, since security forces were aware
that they could easily be filmed and individuals identified in
subsequent investigations. In the case of Ethem Sarısülük’s murder by
the police, the perpetrator was identified using a video stream recorded
by one of the demonstrators.[^04Chapter2_17] The video recordings of Gezi media
were used as evidence by volunteer lawyers and human rights advocates
who formed the *Gezi Law* platform to monitor the detentions, defend the
rights of detainees, and file lawsuits.

Activist collectives are generally nondurable, but their impact can be
more effective than many permanent structures. As Özge Özdüzen
describes, Videoccupy was a temporary ‘single-event focused initiative’
that ‘remained as a symbol of the Gezi protests’.[^04Chapter2_18] Immediately after
Videoccupy’s dissolution, those of us who could devote our time and
labor to the archiving process decided to create another collective.
Motivated by the spirit of the time, forming such an infrastructure was
easy, and we were able to maintain the collective identity.

## Taking the archive out on the streets

The second phase in the emergence of bak.ma involved accordingly the
formation of another video activist collective to generate the archive.
Seven female members of Videoccupy thus created and organized
vidyokolektif. We formed the collective as an extension of the whole
process to understand, digest, and re-produce together, and we went on
to record further protests and commemorations, edit short videos, and
share them on our YouTube channel.[^04Chapter2_19] We worked on organizing the
archival footage and searching for an open-access portal. Slowly,
vidyokolektif emerged as a feminist video activist collective. Not all
the members identified themselves as feminists initially, but we became
convinced over time of the appropriateness of using our medium with a
feminist approach. In short, we had emotional and political reasons for
forming a women’s collective*—*but we also had a mission: we wanted to
set up the archive because we cared about the footage and wanted to
publicize the video collections.

Women are traditionally associated with care. In the case of
vidyokolektif, instead of the traditional connotations of care in
society, I think about care as associated with feminism and with respect
for archival material. Fisher and Tronto’s article reconceptualizing
caring from a feminist perspective steers me to consider our archival
work as carework.[^04Chapter2_20] Fisher and Tronto define care as the activities
people do to maintain, continue, and repair the world that includes
human bodies and the environment and their intertwinement within a
complex and life-sustaining web.[^04Chapter2_21]

According to Alam and Houston, this definition ‘helps expand care ethics
beyond its conceptualization within social science and health research
as an informal, essentialised, gendered-based activity’.[^04Chapter2_22] It
suggests approaching care not as narrowly associated with domestic labor
as identified with women but expansively, associating it with the
environment and maintaining human and non-human relations. Alam and
Houston thus discuss care as an alternate infrastructure. They claim
that the ‘feminist ethics of care shift away from the universal,
abstract, principles of morality and justice’ and advocate for ‘more
attention to "a situated response to unjust situations" by recognizing
the relational, interdependent and unequal capacities of care
actors’.[^04Chapter2_23]

The feminist ethics of care that emerged in our collective experience
was fragile, relational, and an embodied practice. Thus, vidyokolektif
transformed into an infrastructure of care that we created and nurtured
to empower one another as we discussed, shared, produced, and relived
together. We reflected on our relationship with the sensitive archival
material and on how to organize the raw footage and edited material.

In their article on the ethics of feminist care in archival work,
Caswell and Cifor argue that ‘an ethics of care is an inclusive and apt
model for envisioning and enacting justice in archival contexts’.[^04Chapter2_24]
They also emphasize relationality and the responsibilities raised by
connections. Caswell and Cifor propose four interrelated shifts based on
radical empathy in archival relationships: between archives and records
creators, between archivists and records subjects, between archivists
and records users, and between archivists and larger communities
implicated within their records.[^04Chapter2_25] Their conception of ‘archivists as
caregivers bound to records creators, subjects, users, and communities
through a web of mutual affective responsibility’[^04Chapter2_26] reflects
vidyokolektif’s experience.

Daniela Agostinho underlines the ‘affective orientation’ that Caswell
and Cifor associate with the ethical responsibilities of the archivist
who cares about, for, and with subjects, claiming that this ‘represents
a radical shift in the archival encounter, premised as it is on ethical
responsibility rather than liberal modes of access and legal
rights’.[^04Chapter2_27] We developed a mutual responsibility between us and the
video records, events, protestors, commoners, potential users, other
collectives, the Gezi spirit, and the commune. By developing a feminist
ethics of care within vidyokolektif, we carried the work to another
level.

At this point we decided to use pan.do/ra software as it allows users to
manage large, decentralized video collections and collaborative
creations of metadata and time-based annotations online and serves as a
web application. Archive users have a mission in most of the pan.do/ra
archives; such mission differs from a visitor or a researcher in the
archive in its traditional sense. Users are generating the archive
together collaboratively.[^04Chapter2_28] The collaborative ethos and open-source
software vision of pan.do/ra as embodying the knowledge-sharing
philosophy of the copyleft movement corresponded to our practice. Thus,
following the initial online meetings with the software developers, we
organized a workshop in Istanbul to learn the software and launch the
uploading. Finally, in June 2014, during the first anniversary of the
Gezi Park protests, the uploading process started with samples of rough
footage from the collection on the website.

We considered titles for the online archive that would be in tune with
our practice. Referring to our previous discussions, we agreed on
‘bak.ma’, which means ‘do not look’ in Turkish. We used the URL
extension ‘.ma’ for ‘media archive’, which is Morocco’s national URL
extension. Using an URL extension for another country also helped us
with security issues and to establish a kinship with Pad.ma.

The inspiration for naming the archive ‘bak.ma’ had come from our
internal discussions in Videoccupy and vidyokolektif. We shared
quotations from Cypriot thinker Ulus S. Baker on our social media
channels, one of which addressed a police announcement in 1995 that
became part of our internal discussions during the protests as we
witnessed similar police announcements.[^04Chapter2_29] The police announcement
entailed ordering normal citizens passing through the protest area by
chance not to look because police forces were planning to commit
violence, and normal citizens should not witness it. From the beginning
of our video activist and archiving practice, we discussed the
differences between seeing and looking, looking and acting, and how our
video practice disrupted mainstream media’s manipulative and
authoritative gaze. Video activists testified to the police violence and
human rights abuses. For them, the video becomes the eye of citizens.

The name ‘bak.ma’ was chosen for the archive for other reasons, also. We
were there to see, and these were testimonials. Moreover, we thought
that users might be prompted by this name to enter the archive and
browse, and see. But bak.ma is not only about looking and seeing; there
are many significant characteristics that pan.do/ra software provides
and includes in the archive. Not only does pan.do/ra serve the main
default options of viewing, uploading, downloading, categorization, and
annotations, but it also ensures the accessibility of the archive and
admits collective creation, participation, and collaboration. In
general, digital activist archives prioritize archival access, but not
all are open to public participation and collaboration when it comes to
building the archive. They usually provide access to their data via
file-sharing programs, but users and visitors cannot upload files. Some
of those archives are event-based and are not open to data transfer
regarding their restricted context.[^04Chapter2_30]

In June 2014, we created a publicly accessible portal, but the content
was still missing because uploading 4TB of data corresponding to more
than 800 hours of video footage was difficult. The most practical way to
upload that amount of data was ‘mass uploading’, which requires several
desktop computers to run with Linux/Ubuntu. Another member of
Videoccupy, who was familiar with coding and programming, undertook with
me the task of uploading the footage. After long hours of co-working, we
uploaded the entire content before the end of the year. Mass uploading
requires full-capacity computers, so we worked at computer labs.

After uploading the video archive of Gezi generated by the members of
Videoccupy and vidyokolektif, bak.ma was ready for inclusion in more
collections. Between 2013 and 2015, the goal was achieved, and an online
archive was created, comprising the Gezi collection. The fundamental
structure was constituted. However, it required further archival work,
such as categorizing the collection, creating metadata, and entering
annotations, keywords, and necessary information in the archive. There
were already a few people who had joined Videoccupy and vidyokolektif
from my previous video collective, Artıkişler (leftoverworks), and we
decided to do the archival work.[^04Chapter2_31]

## Expanding the archive and its affective potentials 

The third phase of bak.ma began when Artıkişler undertook to do the work
of organizing the archive and producing its metadata with the support of
a few members of Videoccupy and vidyokolektif. Besides working in the
archive, we decided to upload our own collections comprising video
recordings of earlier political events. Then, we collected archival
footage from syndicates, activist collectives, and human rights
organizations in 2015 and 2016. We were invited to present the archive
in Turkey and abroad by various organizations, where we were able to
meet individuals and groups who were interested in collaboration. The
openness, participatory approach, autonomous, and collective structure
of bak.ma drew much attention. Many people and groups were interested in
contributing to using the archive, uploading videos, and participating
in making the archive, and some contributed to the archive with their
own collections and video footage of specific political events.

A guerrilla tv network, *Sendika TV* (Syndicate TV),[^04Chapter2_32] gave us tapes,
video CDs, and digital video discs that had been rescued from police
raids in the basement of their office in Ankara. They asked us to
digitalize the videotapes and upload them on bak.ma with the rest of the
other material. While watching the footage, we realized that most of the
footage belongs to the ‘Tekel Workers’ Resistance’.[^04Chapter2_33] The rest
documented various political events, including the May day celebrations
between 1977 and 2015. We rescued nearly 90 percent of the Syndicate TV
videotape collection from decay. Unfortunately, the tapes had been
damaged by the poor preservation conditions, mostly from dust and
humidity.

The Tekel Resistance was linked to the Gezi Park protests in the way it
demonstrated the power of a struggle for rights and built solidarity
networks across the country which paved the way for the Gezi protests.
Only after watching hours of footage did I realize this. In the occupied
area, in a central part of Ankara, the workers created a ‘tent city’
like in Gezi Park. Every day was filled with actions, including marches,
strikes, rallies, gatherings, concerts, film screenings, talks, and
demonstrations. The resistance was a key moment in the history of social
movements in Turkey since it not only expressed a class-conscious
politics and solidarity but also conquered fears around occupying and
commoning in public spaces.

![Fig. 2.2. Still from bak.ma, excerpt from screenshot of the video file

Recordings 23’, (bak.ma 2015). All content on bak.ma is available under

<br/>

I had visited the tent city several times and joined the demonstrations
at the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010, but only after watching
the video footage could I fully comprehend the resistance in all its
aspects. This experience is in line with the point made by Kate Eichhorn
with respect to feminist archives; namely, that alternative archives are
a site for knowledge production.[^04Chapter2_34] Rather than searching for
preproduced knowledge in places and ways that erase ideas, Eichhorn
invites the reader to engage in the ‘making of archives’ as this is
often ‘where knowledge production begins’.[^04Chapter2_35]

Archives are not only resources for knowledge and information. Thus,
Buchanan and Bastian underline the need to ’shift from seeing archives
as purely informational repositories, to a wider understanding of users’
relationships to records, in particular the affective contours of this
relationship’.[^04Chapter2_36] Activist archives are not just about justice and
rights but also about trauma and grief, victory and defeat, brutality
and intimacy, banality and compassion, and the quotidian routines of
daily life. They are testimonies to the individual spirit, to people in
action, and are laden with affect, overflowing with feeling, and deeply
expressive of human emotion.

Accordingly, Cifor proposes affect as an underlying factor in archival
scholarship and practice.[^04Chapter2_37] Affect, she argues, is a central
component of social justice work: ‘the pain of others that can be found
in archives does not simply belong to others; rather, as inevitable
witnesses to such pain, archivists are deeply implicated in webs of
affective relations’.[^04Chapter2_38] Cifor speaks about ‘emotional justice’ as
something that needs to be expanded in the archival field and its
ethical orientation. For me, the bak.ma collections are about rights and
justice as much as they are about affect.

Collecting and collating footage as well as the archival work of
recordmaking and recordkeeping lead to interlacing affective relations with
the content, its creators, and their collaborations. Similarly, in the
‘10 Theses on the Archive’, co-founders of Pad.ma suggest we think of
the ‘affective potential’ of the archive as there is ‘both a political
as well as an aesthetic question in its ability to activate one’s
capacity to act, and it is on the very faculty of imagination and
possibility that this conflict is located’.[^04Chapter2_39] The affective potential
of activist archives comes from relations among people and groups and
the connections between them and political events. They reach deep into
belonging and empowerment, reminiscence about past losses and
achievements, and ongoing hopes for the future.

The affective potential of activist archives is realized in the
formation of a basis for public debate. As Duygu Doğan and Sidar Bayram
argue, the visual records in these archives contribute to creating
public spaces beyond the juridical space, including academic
institutions and human rights initiatives but also wider artistic and
cultural spaces.[^04Chapter2_40] The emergence of accountability and the potential
of judicial remedy depends on human agency and the publicity that comes
together around these records. When this kind of publicity is not
possible and injust conditions persist, these records preserve and bring
their tacit potential to the future, argue Doğan and Bayram.[^04Chapter2_41] Thus,
such archives are powerful mobilizers of knowledge and memory that can
create global accountability with a force that encompasses not just the
past, but also the present and future.

## Connecting movements: present and future

Bak.ma continued to grow in 2016 as we collected further collections
from video activist collectives. A mission developed of rescuing footage
before it was lost to decay or to wastebins, physical or virtual. In
this way, bak.ma created a kind of juxtaposition between social and
political movements in Turkey and the leftover images of other groups
and collectives. This enabled different archival sites of knowledge to
be linked to each other in digital space.

Through this work, parallelisms among the movements, both major and
minor, became increasingly apparent and available, as in the case of
Gezi and Tekel. Digital activist archives enable us to create these
contexts, affinities, and narratives. They play a significant role in
connecting movements, joining and combining what may otherwise seem
separated and distant. They can meet under the same tags and annotations
or by being aligned, side-by-side and one under the other. New,
nonlinear stories, mappings, and timelines are thereby created on the
archive.

Alongside collecting the residual images of others, bak.ma continued to
document current political events and social issues. Starting in 2018,
it crossed geographical limits and embraced transnational
collaborations. People and collectives from other countries uploaded
their video recordings, texts, photographs, and sound recordings onto
the bak.ma archive. Many people, including previous members of
Videoccupy and vidyokolektif as well as anonymous users, were engaged in
this third phase of the archive. As of 2021, bak.ma has not been
administered by a specific group or organization. Instead, software
developers sustain the online accessibility of the archive, and a few
admins are responsible for the stewardship. Users generate the archival
content since they are automatically granted the permission to download
and upload static files and moving images.[^04Chapter2_42] The number of users
varies. At the time of writing, in 2022, there were 252 signed-up users.
Users are composed of 246 members and six admins. They can create
content and access all publicly shared videos and documents. In
addition, they can organize, annotate, and edit videos and other
documents.[^04Chapter2_43]

The bak.ma video collections consist of audiovisual media of different
formats and lengths but mostly digital raw footage of activist
recordings, feature documentaries, and short films. As bak.ma is an
ever-expanding archive, the size of these collections changes over time.
It is also an archive in progress; classification and annotation of the
collections are ongoing operations. Thus far, the greatest effort has
gone into the preservation, accessibility, and maintenance of the video
collections and the website. Admins and users have been focused on the
fundamental constitutional needs of bak.ma rather than on further
expanding and improving the archive. Many efforts have been made to keep
the online archive alive – covering the yearly software expenses and the
costs of renewal of hard drives and domain.

Structural problems experienced at bak.ma, including the coordination of
the workflow among the volunteers and the lack of financial sources,
make the archive’s future uncertain; its admins and editors cannot
constantly fix problems as they arise. In general, if resources are
limited, then the labor, space, time, financing, and knowledge
limitations of activist archives mean they encounter difficulties in
sustaining their work. The lack of a curatorial and organizational order
is a common problem that directly affects maintenance. Deficient
financial sources cause a lack of coordination and loss of labor. The
voluntary basis of the workflow is not very efficient, since sustaining
a systematic archival workflow requires the input guarantee supplied by
paid workers, and most grants and funds do not cover staff costs.
Activist archives have to tackle this problem since it hinders their
sustainability.

However, activists do not have to tackle these problems from within
discrete silos. I have observed a strong sense of isolation among
activists because of a lack of communication between those involved in
different initiatives. More connectedness between different activists
involved in archiving is needed for the structural problems to be
overcome. Since these archives are based on the reproduction of
relations, then solidarity, collaboration, and connection among the
actors of activist, autonomous infrastructures, commons, and collectives
are key principles to maintain them. The solidarity networks will
definitely empower these practices, provide solutions to their problems,
and ensure the maintenance of the archival work. Accordingly, bak.ma
also will maintain itself as long as it stays in relation with others of
like mind, in alliances, and to the extent that it responds to the needs
of its users, visitors who devote themselves to care for archival
material.

## Conclusion

Through its archival footage, bak.ma invites us to discuss power
structures, the disruption of social inequalities, and labor conditions,
both in Turkey and transnationally. Mobilized activist archival footage
enables us to correlate important political events in history and
comprehend today’s authoritarian politics in a broader context. Thus,
bak.ma addresses the need for collaborative archiving practices in
conflict-affected areas as part of the struggle for human rights,
justice, freedom of speech, and the right to access knowledge. By
housing records of activist collectives, bak.ma becomes their collective
memory, and the archive becomes an agent for testimony as material
witness. Via the lens(es) of bak.ma, users and visitors can take a close
look at a political history that transforms the way of seeing. This look
leads to a mutual, affective sense of responsibility between the
subjects and objects of the action. Encountering fragile and sensitive
archival material is an emotional process. My investigation of the
historiography of bak.ma has shown that emotional connectedness and
affective responsibility are grounded in a caring that transforms our
relations with the past and present and shapes future actions.

    police on the afternoon of May 31, the news channel CNN Türk did not
    change its programming to cover the events and was widely lampooned
    for continuing to broadcast a documentary about penguins. This
    failure became symbolic; the name ‘penguin media’ was soon adopted
    by the protestors and penguins became one of several stock images in
    highly effective and creative collective humor expressed in
    activists’ social media posts, graffiti and other art and shared in
    photographs and videos.

    Berkin Elvan, a 14-year-old boy shot in the head by a tear gas
    cartridge; having struggled for 269 days, Elvan lost his life in the
    morning hours of March 11, 2014. Ali İsmail Korkmaz, a 19-year-old
    student, joined the protests in Eskişehir province; he escaped to
    the city’s side streets, where he was beaten to death by
    plainclothes police officers, and, after struggling for his life in
    a coma for 38 days, lost his life on July 10, 2013. In addition to
    Berkin Elvan and Ali İsmail Korkmaz, other victims who became heroes
    and symbols of the resistance included Ahmet Atakan, Ethem
    Sarısülük, Abdullah Cömert, Mehmet Ayvalıtaş, Hasan Ferit Gedik and
    Medeni Yıldırım. For further information, see ‘Amnesty

[^04Chapter2_28]: Becoming a user on most of the pan.do/ra archives is very simple.
    On bak.ma, each visitor in the archive can have an account and
    become a member by clicking the sign-up button on the top of the
    main page. Without signing up, each visitor can play the videos and
    download them. In addition, visitors can access the collections,
    groups, collectives, and other files, e.g., photographs and pdf
    files on ‘Documents’. However, signing up on the main page is
    necessary to upload any type of data.

    activist content – 858.ma: An Archive of Resistance and leftove.rs
    – do not allow their users to upload any files; they provide only
    viewing and downloading data. On 858.ma, a tutorial for visitors
    explains how to use the archive to search and play the videos. Users
    have the option to create personal lists by signing up, a feature
    not available on leftlove.rs. Also, users cannot create metadata or
    tag and annotate the data on these archives.

[^04Chapter2_31]: The Artıkişler video collective was formed by a group of
    documentary filmmakers, researchers, and video activists in Ankara
    in 2008 and was most active between 2008 and 2021. The collective
    tried to create collective production and distribution spaces in the
    fields of contemporary visual culture and arts, through collective
    working, exhibition, and screening in collaboration with other
    groups and collectives with similar orientations on controversial
    issues in Turkey’s recent social history (urban transformation,
    gentrification, forced migration, labor in urban space, archiving,
    collective political memory, etc.). Artıkişler’s videos were shown
    in many international biennials, festivals, events, and assemblies,
    received awards from international film festivals and organized solo
    exhibitions. Videos, texts, visual research projects, and
    exhibitions are accessible at http://artikisler.net/,

[^04Chapter2_33]: The resistance started in December 2009 following the
    privatization of Tekel, the state monopoly of tobacco and alcoholic
    beverages and its 43 factories. The Turkish government announced
    that the factories would close, with the 12,000 workers redeployed
    to other public sector jobs on 11-month temporary contracts with pay
    cuts of up to 40% and reduced employment rights. This sparked
    industrial action, which began on 15 December, with the workers
    protesting against the cut of their monthly wage and the rescission
    of their right to severance pay.
